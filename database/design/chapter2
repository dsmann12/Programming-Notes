CHAPTER 2 RELATIONAL DATABASES

Relational model is primary model for commercial data processing applications. 

STRUCTURE OF RELATIONAL DATAVSES

Relational database consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name. 

In general, a row in a table represents a relationsihp among a set of values. Since a table is a collection of such relationships, there is a close correspondence between the concept of a table and the mathematical concept of a relation, from which the relational data model takes its name.

A tuple is a sequence (list) of values. 

A relationship between n values in represented mathematically by an n-type of values. 

Relation -> table. 
Tuple -> row

Relation instance - a specific instance of a relation. 

For each attribute of a relation, there is  aset of permitted values, called the domain of that attribute. 

For all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic. Domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units. 

Phone number that can be divided into parts is not atomic. 

DATABASE SCHEMA

Database schema is logical design of the database. 

Database instance is snapshot of database at a given time. 

Relation schema consists of a list of attribtues and their corresponding domains.
