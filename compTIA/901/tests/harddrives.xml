					<Question>What are hard drives?</Question>
					<Answer>Primary form of mass storage.

Hard drive - magnetic drive. Spindle drive. Some form of rotational media. Platters. Read/write head is reading and writing data on the fly. Chip on other side of the hard drive is the controller. Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE). Built in controller. 

Hard Disk Drive HDD - composed of individual disks, or platters, with read/write heads on actuator arms controlled by a srevo motor - all contained in a sealed csae that prevents contamination by outside air. Aluminum platters are coated with magnetic medium. Two tiny read/write heads service each platter, one to read top of platter and other to read bottom of platter. Also known as magnetic har ddrives or platter based hard drives.

Booting PC takes time in part because HDD needs to first spin up before read/write heads can retrieve data off drive and load itinto RAM. All moving metal parts of platter-based drive use a lot of power, create a lot of heat, take up space, wear down over time, and take a lot of nanoseconds to get things done. SSDs address all this.</Answer>

					<Question>What is spindle/rotational speed of HDD?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Spingle/Rotational Speed - HDD run at set spindle speed, with spinning platters measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). Faster the spindle speed, the faster controller can store and retrieve data. 5400, 7200, 10000, 15000 RPM. Faster drives mean better system performance but can also cause computer to overheat. Especially true in tight cases. Heat can also cut life expectancy of HDD. Drive bay fans can be used. </Answer>

					<Question>What are solid state drives?</Question>
					<Answer>Solid State Drive SSD - Based on combination of semiconductors and transistors used to create electrical components with no moving parts. In simple terms, SSDs use memory chips to store data insteal of metal spinning parts. Commonly used in desktop and laptop HDD, memory cards, cameras, USB thumb drives, and other handheld devices. 

Early SSDs used SDRAM that was volatile. Current SSDs use nonvolatile flash memory such as NAND that retains data when power is turned off. Much more expensive than HDDs. Less expensive SSDs typically implement less reliable multi-level cell (MLC) memory technology in place of more efficient single-level cell (SLC) tech to cut sosts.

Typically  1.8, 2.5, and rarely 3.5 inch.</Answer>

					<Question>How do SSDs work?</Question>
					<Answer>SSDs operate internally by writing data in a scattersh otfashion to high speed flash memory cells in accordance with rules contained in internal SSD controller. Process is hidden from OS by presenting an electronic facade to OS that makes SSD appear to be a traditional cylinder/head/sector CHS drive. Sheer speed of internal read/write process far exceeds any slowdowns caused by the CHS-to-memory map translation.

SSD memory cells have finite amount of times they can be written to before wearing out. So would wait until all cells of SSD were filled before erasing and reusing a previously written cell. Casuing something like disk fragmentation. Slowly performance worsens though it may not be noticed.</Answer>

					<Question>What is PATA?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Parallel ATA (PATA) - 40 pin connectors and had 40 pin plug in. Master and slave conections. Ribbon connection. Older drives that sent data in parallel on 40 or 80 wire data cable called ribbon cable.Dominated for more than a decade but have been replaced by serial connectors that use one wire for transfer. 

ATA/ATAPI-7 - last PATA standard. Provides support for v
ery large hard drives (144 petabytes PB, more than 144 m
illion GB) at speds up to 133 MBps. All use standard Mol
ex connector. 

Ancient PATA drives (33 MBps) could get by with a 40 pin
 ribbon cable. Drives that go 66 MBps or faster needed 8
0-wire cable. 

Can connect up to two PATA drives - including HDD, optic
al drives, and tap drives - to single ATA controller. Se

					<Question>What is ATA-3?</Question>
					<Answer>ATA-3 - introducted Self Monitoring and Reporint Technology. SMART. Internal drive program that tracks errors and error conditoins within drive. Information is stored in nonvolatile memory on drive and must be examined externally with SMART reader software. There are generic SMART reading programs and every drive manufacturer has software to get at the vendor-specific information being tracked. Regular usage ofMSART software will help create a baseline of HDD funtionality to predict potential drive failure.</Answer>

					<Question>What is SATA?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">PATA had issues. Ribbon cables impeded airflow and could be pain to insert properly. Cables had a limited length of only 18 inches. And could not hot swap PATA drives. Also tech had reached limits of what it could do in terms of throughput. 

Serial ATA (SATA) - modern connection. Two connectors. Smaller one is data connector. Larger is power connector. Different sized. 3.5 inch drive. Larget. 2.5 inch drive. Connectors identical for each. Smaller for laptops usually.

SATA creates a point-to-point connection between the SATA device (HDD, CDROM, CD-RW, DVD-ROM, dVD-RW, BD-R, BD-RE, etc) and SATA controller, the *host bus adapter (HBA)*. 

Serial connection needs only 7 wires instead of 80 typical of PATA. Did away with entire master/slave concept. Each drive connects to one port. Further, no max number of drives. Many mobos support up to 8 SATA drives. Can add more. </Answer>

					<Question>What is NVMe?</Question>
					<Answer>Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) - specification supports a communication connection between the OS and the SSD directly through a PCIe bus lane, reducing latency and taking full advantage of the speeds of SSD. Come in couple of formats such as add-on expansion card and 2.5 inch drive, like SATA drives for portables. A lot more expensive that other SSDs but much higher speeds.

NVMe - Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification - standard designed from ground up to talk to SSDs. Neat features - designed to run on PCIe bus. Takes advantage of RAM-like aspects of SSD to make system run faster. 16-bit queues? 65336 queues? Must have OS that supported NVME - Windows 8.1 and up do. Windows 7 with updates. Must have mobo that supports NVMe too. Must have NVMe SSD. Can buy PCIe card for this. NVMe standard realized it would need special connections.</Answer>

					<Question>What is logical block addressing?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Logical Block Addressing  (LBA) - HDD. Rotational media and voice coil. Data stored in discrete chunks called sectors. On modern hard drive, these sectors are 4096 bytes. Was only 512 bytes for many decades. SSD store data on flash memory. Data stored in discrete chunks called pages typically sized 4096 bytes. *sectors* on HDD, *pages* on SDD. LBA takes storage devices and stores data in discrete containers called *blocks*. LBA lives on mass storage device. Ignores how data really stored in disk. OS does not care what tech is in drive. OS should have number and disk should return what is stored in that particular container. In order to get to any block, LBA acts as store owner for disk contents. LBA thinks in terms of blocks.

					<Question>Describe Hardware RAID</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Hardware RAID - some type of controller built into system that sets up RAID arrays and presents those arrays to OS as one volume. When need to not let user know any problem has occurred. Intelligent controller handles all RAID functions. Have own processor and memory allowing card instead of OS to handle all work of implementing RAID. Almost all hardware solutions provide hot-swapping. Invisible to OS and configured in several ways. Most have speicla configuration utility in Flash ROM that access after CMOS but before OS loads.

Hardware RAID - typical higher end desktop mobo has hard
ware RAID built into it. Just pick certain number of reg
ular SATA connectors and reconfigure system to do RAID. 
Vast majority of mobos are either all RAID or JBOD (Just
 bunch of discs). Then will need to reinstall Windows be
cause moment go from AHCi to RAID, all controllers are i
mmediately RAID controllers. Some mobos keep some connec
tors as regular connectors. 

Better option is dedicated RAID controller. Has SATA con
nections on it. Whatever plugged into controller is buil
t into RAID array. Usually RAID wants to be added after 
the the system is built. 

Can go into hardware configuration utility of RAID contr
oller. Like System Setup for RAID controller itself. Mus
t define RAID array here. JBOD is like adding more hard 
drives only. No RAID. Follow utility to make RAID array.
 RAID Array just manifests as simple HDD to windows.

How-Swappable - extra system that has hard drives in it. If one drive goes bad, can pull drive out and shove one in without reboot.

					<Question>Describe Software RAID</Question>
					<Answer>Software RAID - telling OS to set up RAID. Disk Management in Windows. In Vista, can only do RAID 0. Can do RAID 0 and RAID 1 in others. OS in charge of all RAID functions. Works for smal lRAID solutions but tends to cause slowdowns in large ones.

Software RAID - Windows. Disk Management. Make disks dynamic for using software RAID. Right click for dynamic. Must have blank drives. Rigth click and select to make a new striped or mirrors volume. Add other drive. 

Span volume - two disks. One disk gets filled up and just continues into other drive. 

Can add mirror to existing drive with software RAID.</Answer>

					<Question>Describe Firmware RAID</Question>
					<Answer>Firmware RAID - take advantage of mobo that has built in RAID functoinalities to set up RAID.

Need to go through mobo documentations. 

Have backup ready. 

System Setup - go to boot. Go to where drives are. Chang
e from AHCI to RAID. 

Intel Rapid Storage Technology - in mobo to handle RAID.
 Do not overwrite OS drive. 

Create RAID Volume.

To take advantage of it, go into OS and in Windows in Di
sk Management. Configure RAID array. Mostly RAID needs t
o be handled at BIOS level.</Answer>

					<Question>Describe installing PATA drives</Question>
					<Answer>Jumpers and Cabling on PATA Drives

If only have one drive, set drive&apos;s jumpers to master or
 standalone. If have two drives, ste one to master and o
ther to slave. Or set both to cable select. Most have di
agram on them to determine settings. 

May have other jumpers. One common set of jumpers is use
d for diagnostics at manufacturuing plant or for special
 settings in other kinds of devices that use hard drives
. Many provide a third setting to be used if only one dr
ive connects to a controller. 

Many PATA hard drives use a jumper setting called cable 
select rather than master or slave. Position of cable de
termiens which drive will be master or slave. Master on 
end, slave in middle. For CS to work properly with two drives, must set both drives as cable select. 

Pin 1- hard drive cables have a colored stripe that corresponds to the number one pin on the connector. Need to make certain that pin 1 on controller is same wire as pin 1 on hard drive.</Answer>

BIOS SETUP

Configuring controllers - make sure they&apos;re enabled. 

Autodetection - if controllers enabled and drive is prop
erly connected, it should appear in CMOS through autodet
ection. PATA had priority according to master/slave seti
ngs. Checked autodetect to make sure it ws right. With SATA, mobos use a numbering system. Uses term *channel* for each controller.</Answer>

					<Question>What are symptoms of problems with hard drives?</Question>
					<Answer>Slow Performance

As problem that points to hard drive troubleshooting issue. Are tools to measure slow performance, but usually talking about basic maintenance issues.

Read/Write Failures - physical drive in system and error popping up at screen saying Data Error Writing To Drive C or Unable To Read Data From C Drive. Can&apos;t really fix these in classical sense but can do error checking. Error Checking launged from GUI. Go through blocks individually and mark bad blocks. Right click on drive and in tools go to Check. Can take hours

Loud clicking noises - replace hard drive

Drive not recognized - Check if installed correctly. Check BIOS if it is properly installed. Check controller to see if it&apos;s on. Are using AHCI when should be using SATA? If BIOS sees it and Windows doesn&apos;t, maybe driver. Probably bad drive otherwise.

OS Not Found - Remove any bootable media that is not primary. Go into BIOS and double check boot order. May have little corruption. Use WindowS Repair Utilities.

Crash Screen - BSoD and pinwheel. Will say FileSystem or NTFS if it actually at HDD level. Error checking or Windows Repair</Answer>

					<Answer>Defragmentation - Under Administrative Tools in Windows 10. Other places in differnt versions of Windows. In general can right click on disks to find defragmentation option. World where now have SSDs, defragmentation is issue with those. With old school magnetic drives, defragmentation was important. Savnig files and erasing them spreads data around. Defragmentation would bring them back together. Widnows 10 will defrag SSDs.

Two Steps: analyze step and then do it step. Runs as automated task in Windows. Make sure it is on.

					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Disk Cleanup - job to erase as much data on HDD as possible to give more space. 

Files in Recycle Bin
Temporary Internet Files - Windows keeps copies off websites graphics and other items so page loads morequickly next time. 
Downloadad Program files - system keeps copy of any Java or ActiveX applets it downloads
Temporary Files - many apps create temp files that are supposed to be deleted when app closes. Sometimes aren&apos;t. Always reside in folder called Temp.

Vista and 7 - Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk Cleanup.

					<Question>What is error checking?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Individual clusters on hard drives sometimes go bad. Cannot prevent this. Important to check.

Chkdsk - command line tool. Does quick scan of drive and reports back. 

chkdsk /f - do not just scan but also fix. 

ScanDisk - command line utility. 

MS calls tool ErrorChecking in new Windows. Mac OS X calls it Disk Utility. 

Linux offers fsck. 

When tools find bad clusters, it puts electroinc equivalent of orange cones around them so system won&apos;t try to place data there. 

Most tools also go through drive&apos;s filenames, looking fo
r invalid names and attempting to fix them. Look for clu
sters with no filesnames associated with them (lost chai
ns) and erase them or save them as files for review. Goo
d tools also check ervery parent and child  folder to make sure parent and child links are valid. 

Error Checking - Windows. Open Exploerer, right click on drive, choose PRoperties, select Tools, and check now to run checkdsk. Check Automaticall fix file system errors, but Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors will take a long time on large drives. 

Disk Utilty - in Utilties folder. When open, get two options such as Verify Disk and/or Repair Disk. Verify Disk checks for errors. Repair Disk fixes those erors. Can verify but not fix the startup disk. If Disk Utility finds errors on startup disk, restart and press APPLE KEY+R until REcovery parition loads. Can fix startup disk from there. </Answer>

					<Question>What is SMART?</Question>
					<Answer>System Monitoring and Reporting Technology - SMART. To create values that are built into HDD where if reach a certain threshold value on these issues, HDD can tell user there is a problem. Just a predictor of failure. Some studies say not that good. Windows has no native SMART support. Mostly seen in BIOS. System will query drive and if anything is bad BIOS will notify in boot process. OS X has built in SMART support. As SMART errors climb, relace drives.</Answer>

					<Question>What is ECC? What is its weakness?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Error Correction Code (ECC) - every drive takes advantage of built-in codes that constantlty checks drive for bad sectors. If ECC detects a bad sector, marks sector as bad in drive&apos;s internal error map. Not to be confusde with FAT. Drive&apos;s internal error map was created at the factory on resrved drive heads and is invisible to the system. If ECC finds a bad sector, you will get a corrupted data error as computer attempts to read the bad sector. Disk checking utilities fix this problem most of the time. 

Often ECC thinks a bad sector is good, however, and fails to update the interna lerror map. Thus, need a program that goes back into drive and marks sectors as bad.

SpinRite - Gibson Reserach. MArks sectors as bad or good more accurates than ECC and does not disturb data.

Otherwise must use a low-level format program supplied by hard drive marker, assuming you can get it. Work like SprinRite but wipe out all dat aon drive. </Answer>

					<Question>What are RAID problems?</Question>
					<Answer>RAID has mostly same problems. 

Drive Not Recognized -If configuration firmware doesn&apos;t recognize one of drives, check to make sure drives are powered and connected to proper connections.

RAID stops - RAID 0, if drive fails, you&apos;ll get BSoD and OS won&apos;t be found on reboot. Other levels don&apos;t do anything extraordinary when one drive fails. Often failure of drive will cause access to contents of drive to slow. Slow performance is clue to check Device Manager or RAID controller firmware. Replace failed drive and let RAID rebuild itself. SMART if need to know reason fo rfailure. 

RAID Not Found 

Implies series of errors where an existing RAID array suddenly fails to appear. They vary greatly depending on make and model of hardware RAID or software RAID. Properly functioning hardware RAID wil lalays show up in configuration utility. If anexisting array stops working and enter configuration utility only to find the array is gone, then its big trouble. Points to either dead drives or faulty controllers. Must replace. 

If array is gone but can still se drives, then controller may have broken array on its own. Rare action some controllers do to try to save data. Try to rebuild array using tools controllers provide.</Answer>
