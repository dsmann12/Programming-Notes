					<Question>What is a PSU?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">PSU - powers computer. Takes electricity from wall socket and transform it into electricity to run mobo and other internal components.

Power Supply - ATX typical. All in Watts. That is its ma
x power. Use soft power. Power isn&apos;t by physical switch 
in power supply. Instead, jumper set on mobo itself that
 is power switch. Can set switch to do different things 
(sleep mode). Switch is more like cutoff switch. Rarely 
if ever turned off. 

PSU in a computer converts high-voltage AC power from th
e wall socket to low-voltage DC.

					<Question>Describe how PSU powers computer?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">PSU in a computer converts high-voltage AC power from th
e wall socket to low-voltage DC. 

First step in powering PC is to get and maintain a good 
supply of AC power. Second, need a PSU to convert AC to 
proper voltage and amperage of DC power for mobo and per
ipherals. Finally, need to control byproduct of electric
ity - namely heat. 

Supplying AC

PC PSU must have standard AC power supplied steadily and protection against accidental blurps in supply. Power supply connects to the power cord (and thus electrical outlet) via a standard *IEC-320* connector.

Supplying DC

PSU converts high-voltage AC into several DC voltages (5.0, 12.0, 3.3V) usable by delicate interior components. 

Most common size is standard 150mm x 140mm x 86mm. </Answer>

					<Image>IEC-320 Connector</Image>
					<Answer>IEC-320 Power Connector

IEC-320 plug has three holes, called hot, neutral, and ground. Hot wire carries electrical voltage. Neutral wire carries no voltage but acts as water drain, completing circuit by returning electricity to local source, normally a breaker panel. Ground wire makes it possible for excess electricity to return safely to ground, such as in short-circuit condition.</Answer>

					<Question>What should you do before plugging in a computer?</Question>
					<Answer>Test outlet before plugging in PC. Use multimeter or device designed to test outlets. Bad outlet could result in inoperable or destroyed equipment as well as possible electrocution. 

When testing AC, check three things:
1. Hot outputs approximately 115V
2. Neutral connects to ground (0V) 
3. ground connects to ground  (OV)</Answer>

					<Question>What is a multimeter?</Question>
					<Answer>Multimeter - or volt-ohm meter (VOM) or digital multimeter (DMM) to measure aspects of electrical current. Consists of two probes, an analog or digital meter, and a dial to set the type of test. V with aolid line above a dashed line refers to DC. V~ refers to AC. Offer at least 4 types of electrical tests: continuity, resistance, AC voltage (VAC), and DC voltage (VDC). Continuity tests whether electrons can flow from one end of a wire to other end. Can be used to determine if a fuse is good or to check for breaks in wires. Resistance tester - Broken wire or fuse will show infinite resistance, while good one will show no resistance. Testing AC or DC voltages is matter of making sure measured voltage is what it should be.</Answer>

					<Question>What is an AC adapter?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">AC Adapters - many devices use AC adapter rather than internal PSU. Sits outside a device and converts AC current to DC. Rarely interchangeable. Must make sure voltage, amperage, and polarity match before plugging one into device. If voltage or amperage output is too low, device won&apos;t run. If too high, can roast the device. If polarity is reversed, won&apos;t work just like putting a battery in a flashlight backward. </Answer>

					<Question>Describe ATX PSUs. What is soft power?</Question>
					<Answer>Original ATX PSUs had two distringuishing physical featu
res:
1. Mobo Power Connector
2. Soft Power

Mobo power came from single cable with p1 power connecto
r. ATX PSUs also had at least two other cables, each populated with two or more Molex or mini connectors for peripheral poower. 

When plugged in, ATX systems have 5V running to mobo. Always on, even when powered down. Power switch on ATX system simply tells computer whether it has been pressed. BIOS or OS takes over from there and handles chore of turning PC on or off. This is *soft power*.

Using soft power instead of a physical switch prevents a user from turning off a system before OS has been shut down. Enables PC to use power saving modes that put system to sleep and then wake it up on event.</Answer>

					<Question>Describe ATX12V 1.3</Question>
					<Answer>ATX12V 1.3

First widespread update to ATX standard. 2003. 

P4 - unofficial name for 4 pin power connector for mobo introduced that provided more 12V power to assist the 20 pin P1 mobo power connector. Any power supply that supplide this connector is an ATX12V PSU. 

SATA also supports slimline connctor that has a 6 pin power segment and a micro conncetor that hasa 9 pin power segment. 

AUX connector - introduced 6 pin auxilliary connector to supply increased 3.3 and 5.0V current to mobo. Based on mobo power connector from AT. 

Teething issues. Many AMD CPUs needed AUX cable, while Intel CPUs needed only P4. Sometimes would not include one or other.

					<Question>Describe EPS12V</Question>
					<Answer>EPS12V 

Server mobos needed more power. 

Developed by Server System Infrastructure (SSI). Came with 24-pin main mobo power connector that resemebled 20pin ATX connector but offered more current and tthus more stability for mobos. Also came with AUX connector, ATX12V P4 connector, and a unique 8-pin connector. 

Were not interchangeable with ATXV12 psus. 

Didn&apos;t see much life beyond servers, but introduced a number of power featured which would eventually be part of ATX12V standard.

					<Question>What are rails? What is OCP?</Question>
					<Answer>RAILS

Generally, all PC power comes from a single transformer 
that takes the AC current from wall socket and converts 
it into DC current that is split into three primary DC v
oltage rails: 12.0 V, 5.0 V, and 3.3V. Groups of wires r
un from each of these voltage rails to various connector
s. 

Each rail has max amount of power it can supply. Normal 
computers rarely approach this ceiling, but powerful com
puters with advanced processors and graphics cards requi
re more power. In past 12V rails only supplied about 18 
amps which was not enough for high end equipment.

Solution - include 12V rails in PSUs. Worked fine but ne
eded to make sure wren&apos;t drawing all power from same 12V rail. Key circuitry that monitors amount of ampearge going through each rail, called the over-current protection (OCP), will shut down PSU if current goes beyond it cap. 

Single rail - single OCP monitors all pathways

Multi-rail - each pathway gets it own OCP. When first implemented, didn&apos;t do a great job balancing circuitry but:

Today&apos;s PSUs prodduce single and multi-rail, high amperage power. Can find PSUs with 12V rails pushing 50 amps or more.

Rails - Taking volts from household current and outputting that into 12, 5, and 3.3V DC. Process of converting AC 120 or 220V power into 3.3, 5, or 12V power requires a lot of switching, a lot of transformers, and because that, you may have enough wattage, but because different outputs plug into different places, one connection might not provide enough power. Especially bad for 12V. Rails are electric circuitry that isolate different types of power outputs and so one does not get sacrified by other in order to do best efficiency possible. 

2-Rail system - two rails. Minimum you should have. 

2, 3, 4 rails on PSU on real good systems. Ruleset almost goes out the window for really expensive CPUs.</Answer>

					<Question>What are harmonics?</Question>
					<Answer>Harmonics - PSU takes gults only when current is fully pushing or pulling at top and bottom of each cycle and creating an electrical phemonea. Sort of a back prssure. Called harmonics. Create humming sound heard in electronics. Over time, harmonics dmage electrical equipment, causing problems with PSU and other electrical devices on circuit.</Answer>

					<Question>What is 80 Plus?</Question>
					<Answer>80 Plus - voluntary standards program. Rated from 80 to 94 % for given load and badged with metal lables suchas Bronze (85%), Gold (90%), Titanium (94%). These levels are achieved within a narrow range of watts provided, while lower levels of efficiency are achieved at higher and lower power draw. Pwer and efficiency curves usually provided in PSU docs.</Answer>

					<Question>How are PSUs maintained in best condition?</Question>
					<Answer>Power Supply Fan - provides basic cooling for PC. Not on
ly cools votage regulator circuits within PSU but also p
rovides a constant flow of outside air through interior 
of computer case. Dead power supply fan can rapidly caus
e problems. 

Modern computers should have one or two case fans as well.</Answer>

					<Question>What is airflow?</Question>
					<Answer>Airflow - Computer is an enclosed system and cases help fans keep thing scool. Airflow in closed case substantially cools off interior components. 

Remember hot air rises. Warm air rises above cold air. In take fan located near bottom of front bezel of case draws cool air in from outside. Near top and rear is exhaust fan. Works opposite of intake fan and pushed warm air from inside to outside. 

Also ensure slot covres are covering all empty expansoins bays. 

Fans generate noise. Reduce fan noice by using manually adjustable fans, larger fans, or special quiet fans. Manually adjustable fans have knob to speed up or slow them down. Better solution is quiet fans. Large fans spin slower and produce less noise.

Traditionally, industry used 80mm PSU and cooling fans, but today you&apos;ll find 100mm, 120mm, and even larger fans. 

SpeedFan or Mobo software allow you to tweak fans based on tempuratures.</Answer>

					<Question>How to troubleshoot PSU?</Question>
					<Answer>TROUBLESHOOTING

Most likely to die. Take a lot of abuse from bad electri
city. 

1. Catastrophic
2. Slow

Catastrophic - no power. Nothing is coming on. Can get w
orse than that. Pop and smoke coming out. Probably blown
. Always unplug PSU when it goes bad. Likely destroys mo
bo. 

Multimeter can check if PSU is dead. Check everything el
se before assuming PSU. Do not fret if voltages supplied
 are more or less than nominal value. PSUs can safely va
ry by as much as 10%. Meaning 12V line can vary from 10.
8 to 13.2 V. Test every connection on PSU. 

ATX Tester - for testing PSUs without mobo. Without mobo
, PSUs won&apos;t turn on. 

Switches - Short power jumpers on mobo with screwdriver 
if think PSU switch is problem

Slow - To do a test, can use a Voltmeter. Biggst V on a PSU is 12 V so always pick highest range as close to but above. Paper clip - Green wire is power good wire. Can put one end of paper clip in power good and another in a black ground wire. Voltage tester - put a little load on system. But don&apos;t know their limitations. Sometimes one connector goes bad. 

Intermittent problems arethe clue. Multimeter not elpful as voltages will only once in a hilwe spike and sag to cause intermittent errors.</Answer>
