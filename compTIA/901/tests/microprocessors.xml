					<Question>What is the system crystal?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">System crystal determines the speed at which a CPU and rest of PC operate. Usually a quartz oscillator soldered onto motherboard. Sends out electirical pulse at a certain speed, many millions of times per second. Goes first to a clock chip that adjusts the pulse, usually increasing the pulse sent by crystal by some multiple. 

(Motherboards could connect crystal directly to CPU&apos;s clock wire but then would need to replace crystal if wanted to replace CPU with a CPU with a different clock speed)

As long as computer is powered on, the quarts oscillator repeatedly fires a charge on CLK wire, setting beat for CPU activities. If system crystal sets a beat slower than CPU&apos;s clock speed, it will run at a slower speed. If system crystal forces CPU to run faster than its clock speed, it can overheat and stop worknig. 

Before installing a CPU, make sure crystal and clock chip send out correct clock pulse for that particular CPU. Today, motherboard talks to CPU. CPU tells mobo the clock speed it needs, and clock chip automatically adjusts for CPU. </Answer>

					<Question>What is the relationship between memory and EDB?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Computer needs some device that take copies of programs from hard drives and sends them one line at a time to CPU quickly enough to keep up with its demands. Memory is device that stores ones and zeroes and stores them by addressing each line of memory, so CPU can easily find data. Moves data from memory to EDB. CPU can read and write to this storage medium and can jump to any line of stored code as easily as any other. All this is done near clock speed of CPU. </Answer>

					<Question>What is a memory controller chip?</Question>
					<Answer>CPU and RAM need some connection to talk to each other. Must extend EDB from CPU to talk to RAM. Need EDB to connect in such a way that CPU can see any one give nrow but still give CPU capability to look at any row. CPU needs to be able to say which row of RAM it wants and chip should handle mechanics of retrieving that row of data from RAM and putting it on EDB. 

MCC contains special circuitry so it can grab contents of any single line of RAM and palce that data or command on EDB. Enables CPU to act on code. CPU needs to be able to tell MCC which line of code it needs. So CPU gains second set of wires called address bus, with which it can communicate with MCC. Different CPUs have different numbers of wires.</Answer>

					<Question>What is a clock multiplier?</Question>
					<Answer>Clock multiplier in CPU makes CPUs run at some multiple of system clock speed. Take motherboard speed nad increase it by 8x to 16x to 20x. 

200 MHx mobo. 1.6 GHz CPU. So 8x multiplier: 200MHz x 8 = 1.6 GHz. 

System crystal pushes out a particular speed (motherboard speed) which is then multiplide internally by CPU to get full speed. 

i7 can go up 3.4 GHz. Mobo runs at 100MHz. So multiplier goes up to x35 at full load. 

Clock speed and multiplier on early clock-multiplying systems had to be manually configured via jumpers and dual in-line package (DIP) switches on motherboard. Today, CPUs report to motherboard through function called CPUID and speed and multiplier are set automatically. Can manually override this automatic setup on motherboards by overclocking.</Answer>

					<Question>What is multicore architecture?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Dual core architecture means there are two cores on a single chip. Dual core CPU has two execution units -- two sets of pipelines -- but the two sets of pipelines share cache and RAM.

Now 4, 6, or 8 cores.

Core i7 has L1, L2, and L3 caches of 64 KB, 256KB, and 15MB. L1 cache divides into 32KB to handle data (D-Cache) and another 32 Kb for instructions (I-cache). Each core has dedicated L1 and L2 caches. All cores share L3 cache. Pool of memory enables cores to communicate nad work together without having to access RAM. 

Multicore processing has engineered cores to divide up work independently of OS. Still, apps have to be modified or optimized for this parallelism to have a huge impact on performance. </Answer>

					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Virtualization support - create virtualized extra systems on same system. Saves on power, if system goes down, can restore it from file. But takes lots of work from CPU. To reduce workload, have virtualization support. Setting to turn on in BIOS. 

Old. Virtualization used to work entirely through software. Programmers had to write lots of code to enable a CPU - which was designed to run one OS at a time - ro run more than one OS. How does memory get allocated, how does CPU know which OS to update when type something or click icon. 

With hardware based virtualization, CPUs took a lot of burder off programmers and made virtualization easier.

					<Question>What are the steps from a CPU must take to process a command?</Question>
					<Answer>To get command from data bus, do the calculation, and then get answer back out to data bus a CPU takes at least four steps (stages):
1. Fetch - get data fro mEDB
2. Decode - Figure out what type of commands needs to be executed.
3. Execute - Perform the calculation.
4. Send data back onto EDB

Smart discrete circuits inside CPU handles these stages.

In early CPUs, when command was placed on data bus, each stage did its job and CPU handed back answer before starting next command. Required at least 4 clock cycles to process a command. In every clock cycles, three of four cirtcuits sat idle. 

Now there is pipelining.</Answer>

					<Answer xml:space="preserve">In early CPUs, when command was placed on data bus, each stage did its job and CPU handed back answer before starting next command. Required at least 4 clock cycles to process a command. In every clock cycles, three of four cirtcuits sat idle. 

Pipeline - today circuits are organized in conveyor-belt fashion called a pipeline. With pipelining, each stage does its job with each clock cycle pulse, creating a much more efficient process. Keep every stage of processor busy on every click of clock, making CPU run more efficiently without increasing clock speed. 

Current CPU pipelines contain up to 20 stages.

Not perfect, Sometimes a stage hits a complex command that requires more than one clock cycle, forcing pipeline to stop. CPU tries to avoid these stops, called pipelines stalls?

The decode stage tends to cause most pipeline stalls; certain commands are complex and therefore harder to decode than other commands. Current processors use multiple decode stages to reduce chance of pipeline stalls due ot complex decoding. </Answer>

					<Question>What is the ALU and FPU?</Question>
					<Answer>Inside CPU is composed of multiple chunks of circuitry to handle many types of calculations PC needs.

Arithmetic Logic Unit (APU) - handles integer math. Basic math for numbers with no decimal point. Typical CPU spends most work doing integer math.

Floating Point Unit (FPU) - special circuitry to handle complex numbers. With single pipeline, only FPU or ALU worked in execution stage. Worse, floating point calculation often took many clock cycles to execute forcing CPU to stall pipeline until FPU finshed executing complex command 

Current CPUs use multiple pipelines to keep processing going.</Answer>

					<Question>What is a PGA socket? An LGA socket?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">A PGA (Pin Grid Array) Socket - pins on processor. Break a pin and CPU is dead. AMD.

A LGA (Land Grid Array) Socket. Intel. Pins are on socket itself. CPU has pads (or lands) on itself. Harder to dmanage CPU.

					<Question>What is microarchitecture?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Microarchitecture defines how CPU processes instructions. The reason for different sockets. Supported 3-5 yeras. Thinking of new technologies, speed improvements, reducing transistor sizes to fit more on processor. Come up with pattern for new stuff. Core pieces of what next version of CPU will do. 

Usually there is one microarchitecture and features are cut down for lower systems. Some added for mainstream, more added for server, etc. 

In general when new microarchitecture comes along, a new socket does too. Not always though. </Answer>

					<Question>What is liquid cooling? What are the two types?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Liquid Cooling - take CPU and put metal mount on it. Liquid goes through mount to take heat away to cool off and cycle it back. Metal mounted to CPU. Radiator mounted to case.

Passive Liquid Cooling - liquid goes through a big mount on top of CPU, gets heated up, runs through a radiator to cool down, and pump pushes it back again. 

Active Liquid Cooling - refridgerator. Only done by few people. Passive most common type. </Answer>

					<Question>What is overclocking?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">For CPU to work, motherboard speed, multiplier, and voltage must be set properly. In most systems, motherboard uses CPUID functions to set these automatically. Some mobos enable you to set this manually by moving a jumper, changing a CMOS setting, or using software. Many change settings to enhance performance. 

Overclocking - running CPUs at clock speeds higher than whay they were rated for. Can void warranty for CPU. Can cause damage. 

Intel and AMD make utilities to help overclock. 

Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (Intel XTU) - Don&apos;t skip additoinal Performance Tuning Protection Plan if go this route. 

AMD Overdrive Utility - No extra warranty.

Most make couple of adjustments to overclock. First, through jumpers, CMOS settings, or software configuration, would increase bus speed for system. Second, often have to increase voltage going into CPU by a little to provide stability. Do that by changing jumpre or CMOS setting. 

Can lock up system. Must do CMOS clear. </Answer>

					<Question>What can cause overheating and how to fix it?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">A failure to install CPU results in either nothing or a system lock-up in a short period of time. Because the nature of ZIF sockets, almost guarantted issue isn&apos;t CPU but rather installation of heat sink and fan.

1. Too much thermal paste can impede flow of heat from CPU to heat sink and cause CPU to heat up rapidly. Modern CPUs have built in fail-safes to shut down before heat damage. 

2. Not enough thermal paste or paste spread too unevenly can cause CPU to heat up and consequently shut itself down. 

3. Failure to conncet the fan power to the mobo can cause CPU to heat up and shut down.

Environmental factors frequently include dust and pet hair. Air conditioning failures. 

CPU needs adequate ventilation. CPU fan is essential but inside of case also needs to get hot air out through exhaust fans and cool air in. If intake fans or exhaust fans stop working, it could cause issue. </Answer>

					<Question>What can cause catastrophic failures and what to do?</Question>
					<Answer>Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) tells catastrophic failure. Technically called a Windows Stop Error.

Mac OS X get pin wheel on screen. 

CompTIA calls these &quot;proprietary crash screens&quot;

If smoke or pop from case, use nose to smell what hardware malfunctioned. If electrical short hit CPU, it likely damaged motherboard too.</Answer>
