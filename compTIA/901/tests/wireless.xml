					<Question>What are bands used for wireless networks?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Is radio so needs radio frequency.

ISM Industrial Scientific and Medical Bands - anyone can use these. Don&apos;t need license from FCC. Use bands from everything from baby monitors to wireless home phones. 

2.4 Ghz Bands

5 Ghz Bands

Bands - range of frequencies

					<Question>Describe 802.11</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">802.11 breaks bands down into 11 channels. You tell wireless access point to choose a channel. Channels keep devices from interfering with each other.

802.11 - first standard came out in 1997. Primary technology used for wireless networks. </Answer>

802.11G - took over world. Took all goodness of A and B and put in one standard. Ran at 2.4Ghz band at 54 Mbps. A G access point could communicate with B devices since they run at 2.4Ghz. Could not communicate with A because it ran at 5Ghz.</Answer>

					<Question>Describe 802.11N</Question>
					<Answer>802.11N - brought a lot of complexity. Ran at both 2.4 and 5.0Ghz band. And ran at top speed of 600Mbps. Introduced MIMO - Multiple Input, Multiple Output - brought idea of data streams. If had enough radios or antennaes, could send more than one piece of data to an individual client or groups of clients. Each antennae would create a stream. Could create up to 4 stream. Downside is that it worked in 2.4 Ghz band. Most properly configured N access points only did stuff in 5.0 Ghz band and used 2.4Ghz band for backwards compatbility</Answer>

					<Question>What is WEP?</Question>
					<Answer>WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy - wasn&apos;t very good. Not bad encryption but way it worked was poor. If encrypt packet, then must bring key along with every packet so people can unlock it. And key must change or people will figure it out. Like secret decoder ring and iterated code after every packet. If know that ahead of time you can mathematically figure out key. 

64 bits or 128bit. Problem was 24 bits of key were used as initialization vector. So really only have 40 bits for 64bit.

People who came up with 802.11 knew this and came up with authentication method, which allowed you to talk to WAP, and encryption mode, which protected data. Bad standard. Authetication would transmit passwords in clear as part of authentication process. Pretty much ignored now so anyone can talk to WAP. Need encryption to get passed WAP.</Answer>

					<Question>What are common wireless problems?</Question>
					<Answer>Interference - when connect to wireless network, you establish a certain speed that you and network will run at. L
et&apos;s say 802.11G. 54 Mbps is top speed, but interference can have it run slower. Determine what speed hardware has
 agreed with WAP to run. 

Resoure Monitor in Windows. Go into status of like ink Network and Sharing Center. If speed dips, usually its inte
rferences.

Have interference when WAP starts stomping on channel or things like baby monitors and call phones. Can either kil
l the interference or run away from it. Will have to get rid of interfering devices, set channel to WAP to somethi
ng different, or go somewhere else. 

No internet. Can&apos;t get on internet but can connect to WAP network. First, check IP address. If APIPA, then probabl
y bad password. 

Working on network then suddenly can&apos;t get on. Two aspects of network, the site survey (a list of all wireless net
works in area) and the connection itself. Once make connection to SSID, everything is going to be remembered. Such
 as authentication and password. If go into WAP and change authentication and encryption, then you won&apos;t be able t
o get on without updating settings. Must tell pc to forget the network and then give correct credentials.</Answer>

					<Question>How to connect to a wifi network with Windows?</Question>
					<Answer>Need to find wireless network. Windows 7. There&apos;s connection bars in system tray. Click it and see a site survey of available connections. Hovering over connection will give its details. Can right click and select properties. Just because connected does&apos;t really mean connected. If IP address is legitimate it will have same Network ID.</Answer>

					<Question>What is WPS?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Wifi Protected Setup WPS - need WPS enabled equipment. Usually button in back of router. Press button then have a few minutes to get to device (printer) and press button there. As long as press buttons they will set themselves up. Also have 8 digit code that can be typed in as password on windows. Problem is that its incredibly hackable and crackable. 8 digit code - 1 digit is not used so really 7 digit code and it is passed in two chunks: one of 4 digits and one of 3. Should find a way to turn it off. Some situations where you can&apos;t turn off WPS. </Answer>

					<Question>What a common troubleshooting issues with wireless?</Question>
					<Answer>User maybe can&apos;t get on network. Or network has low signal. Or an intermittent signal. 

WAP not configured right. SSID hidden and not known. 

Antannaes - tend to want to be in straight up motion. People like to play with them. 

Should know what wireless networks are out there. Also how strong are these signals. Most clients with Windows and other OSes have these tools. Only downside is they don&apos;t give channels. Tons of tools to check channels on mobile phones and such.  

AP isoltation - if running in coffee shop, client can hook up to WAP but cannot see any other computer hooked to the network. 

TX Power - transmit power. WAP often don&apos;t transmit as hard as radios will allow by default. Can install other firmware on router (DD-WRT) to get extra features.  Also good for turning down power, which can hide network from others farther away. 

Third party antennaes - will improve signal quality. But longer wire from router means getting less signal.

Make sure correct people are on network and others aren&apos;t.

MAC filter - can enable in settings. Can permit only clients listed to access network. Or prevent certain clients listed from accessing network.</Answer>

					<Question>How does bluetooth work?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Bluetooth - been around a while. 
 
Profiles - If have a bluetooth device is must have ability to need certain functions or provide certain functions. Bluetooth headset provides a microphone and a speaker and thus can connect it to phone. One profile that handles that.

Personal Area Network (PAN) - where two devices share data with each other. 

Pairing - one device must become discoverable. Other device must see it. The first device must provide a passcode, then put that pass code into second device and should be connected. 

Three classes of bluetooth devices:
Class 1 - 100M
Class 2 - 10M
Class 3 - 1M

Most devices class 2 or 3. </Answer>
