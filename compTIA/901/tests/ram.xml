					<Question>What is DRAM?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">DRAM - Dynamic Random Access memory. First ever used in computers. Means every bit is stored with little capacitor and little transistor. Number of changes over the yeras. 

Like electronic spreadsheet. Each cell is special type of semiconductor that can hold a single bit by using microscopic capacitors and transistors. DRAM put semiconductors into chips that can hold a certain number of bits. Bits inside the chip are organized in rectangular fashion using rows and columns. Each chip has limit on number of lines of code it can contain. Also limit on width of data. One chip might handle 8 bit wide data and another might handle 16bit wide data. x8 and x16 respsectively. 

Low cost, high speed, capability to contain a loft of data in a relatively small package.

					<Question>How did DRAM work with CPU and historically.</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Needed RAM that could store 8bit (1 byte) chunks so MCC could put 8 bit chunk on EDB when CPU asked for line of code. All DRAM back then had 1 bit width. So sizes such as 54k x 1 or 256k x 1. 

Solution: Take eight 1 bit wide chips and use MCC to organize them electroincally to be 8 bit wide. 

More complex command in 8088 were 2 bytes wide. MCC dealt with this by taking command 1 byte at a time. Took twice as long to handle command. 

8086 - 16 bit frontside bus but otherwise identical to 8088. But no affordable MCC or RAM to handle 2 bytes, so IBM bought 8088. 

As CPU data bus sizes increased, so did need for RAM wide enough to fill bus.

DRAM stcisk.

Intel 80386 had 32bit data bus. DRAM manufacturers created wider DRAM chips, such as x4, x8, and x`16 and putting multiples of them on a small circuilt board called a stick or module (Single Inline Memory Module)

Modern CPUs have some commands that are 64bits wide. To optimize flow of data into and out of CPU, the modern MCC provides at least 64 bits of data every time CPU requests information from RAM. 

Modern DRAM chips come in 32bit and 64bit wide data form factors with varying number of chips. x32 or x64. When CPU needs certain bytes of data, it requests those bytes via the address bus. MCC keeps trakc of RAM and how many DRAM chips work together to provide memory. Gives it to CPU. </Answer>

					<Question>What is SDRAM?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM. Synchronized with system clock, just like CPU and MCC, so MCC knows when data is ready to be grabbed from SDRAm and little time is wasted. 168 pin DIMM (Dual In-Line Memory Module). Two notches in it. Pins on either side of sick have different jobs. Has clock speed. Must get right spede for motherboard. Intel and other companies got together to create speed ratings fror RAM.6Mhz Motherboard - PC66. 100Mhz Motherboard - PC100 speed. PC ratings. Lasted a long time. Not in PCs so much now but in other equipment (printers).

Laptops came in 68-pin, 144-pin, or 172-pin micro DIMM package. And 72-pin, 144-pin, or 200-pin small outline DIMM(SO-DIMM)

SDRAM speed was tied to system clock so its clock speed matched the frontside bus. Five clock speeds were common: 66, 75,83,100, 133 MHz. RAM speed had to match or exceed system speed of computer or pc would not work. 

For Pentium III with 100 MHz fontside bus, you need to buy SDRAM DIMMs rated at PC100 or PC133. </Answer>

					<Question>What is DDR SDRAM?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">DDR SDRAM - Dual Data Rate SDRAm. Wanted to go faster. 184 pin DIMM package. One notch. Took motherboard speed and doubled it so every click of system clock you got two RAM clocks. Copied Rambus, doubling the througput of SDRAM by making two processes for every clock cycle. Speed up RAM without having faster motherboards. 

To calculate PC Rating and DDR SPed: Take motherboard speed and double it. That&apos;s DDR Speed. Then multiply that by 8. THat&apos;s PC Rating. 

Copied Dual Channel Architecture from RDRAm. Using two sticks together to increase throughput. Must be identical sticks

DDR Speed is for individual DDR chips. (8 chips on stick). PC is for DDR sticks.

					<Question>What is DDR2 RAM?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">DDR2 - Improved DDR. Enhancements enabled it to run faster than DDR while using less power. Big speed increase comes by clock doubling the input/output circuits on the chips. Does not speed up core RAM (part that holds data) but speeding up input/output and adding special buffer (like a cache) makes it run much faster. 240 pin DIMM. One notch. Different place than regular DDR. Gets more complicated. Take Motherboard speed and double that for DDR speed. Then to get DDR2 speed, must double DDR speed. Multiply by 8 to get PC Speed. </Answer>

					<Question>What is Parity RAM?</Question>
					<Answer>ECC or Parity RAM - memory that has extra chips designed for error correction. Usually only seen on big server systems. Can only be used on motherboard that accept them. Bank server, for example, must resist even smallest errors. 

Parity RAM - stored an extra bit of data (called parity bit) that MCC used to verify whether dat awas correct. Wasn&apos;t perfect. Would&apos;t always detect an error and if MCC did find an error, it couldn&apos;t correct it.</Answer>

					<Answer>ECC or Parity RAM - memory that has extra chips designed for error correction. Usually only seen on big server systems. Can only be used on motherboard that accept them. Bank server, for example, must resist even smallest errors. 

Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM - major advance. First ECC detects any time a single bit is incorrect. Second, ECC fixes these errors on the fly. Checking and fixing come at price as ECC is always slower. Can find DDR2, DDR3, or DDR4 sticks thta come in 240-pin 72 bit versions. Extra 8 bits for error checking.</Answer>

					<Question>What is latency?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">RAM responds to electirical signals at varyingrates. When memory controller starts to grab a line of memory, a slight delay occurs. After RAM sends out requested line of memory, another slight delay before controller can ask for another line. 

Latency - delay in RAM&apos;s response time. RAM with lower latency (CL6) is faster than RAM with higher latency (CL9). CL refers to clock cycle delays. 6 means memory delays 6 clock cycles before delivering data, etc. </Answer>

					<Question>What is registered or buffered RAM?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Registed and Buffered Memory - especially with ECC. Registered or Buffered RAM. Either term refers to a small register installed on some memory modules to act as a buffer between DIMM and memory controller. Extra bit of circuitry helps compensate for electrical problems that crop up in systems with lots of memory modules, such as servers. Motherboards will use either buffered or un-buffered (regular consumer RAM), not both. </Answer>

					<Question>What are two indications that RAM was no properly installed?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Most DDR Memory is Dual or Quad channel. Means must put in two or 4 sticks. Every stick in channel must be same speed and same capacity. 

Two cases to see if messed up:

1, Computer doesn&apos;t boot.
2. Don&apos;t see RAM that was added. 

Don&apos;t put different size RAM in same channel.

					<Question>What shoud you check if you beliee there is a RAM problem?</Question>
					<Answer>Check Windows to see how much RAM system asys it has. Click start, right click computer, select properties. Instal
led Memory. 

CPU-Z - SPD (Serial Presence Detect) - like CPU info but for RAM. Tells exactly type of RAM have, how big it is, i
nformation for each slot. 

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). Everything has MTBF. RAM has MTBF measured in decades. Assuming taken care of. 
Blue Screen of Death symptom, reboots, freezes, melting screen. All errors point to bad RAM. 

Either pull RAM out or use memory testing tools. 

MemTest86 - older program but reliable. Tests memory. Very slow process. Takes hours to run. Boot into it, from IS
O disc in optical media or flash drive. Reports something wrong in hex. Doesn&apos;t say &quot;that sticks bad&quot;. If it shows
 an error, you know one stick is bad. Use process of elimination. 

Windows 7 and later - comes with memory testing tool. Control Panel -&gt; Adminstrative Tools -&gt; Windows Memory Diagn
ostic. Must run on its own, will restart computer.</Answer>

					<Question>What are symptoms that show there may be a problem with RAM?</Question>
					<Answer>Symptoms:

General system sluggishness and excessive hard drive accessing. Programs take long time to load and seem to stall 
and move slowly.

Memory Errors show up in variety of ways on modern systems, including parity errors, ECC error messages, system lockups ,p[age faults, and other rror screens. Can indicate bad RAM but often point to something unrelated. 

Real and phantom parity errors - Real parity errors are simply errors that MCC detects from parity or ECC chips. OS reports problem in  error message. &quot;Parity error at A5F2:004EEAB9). Almost always indicates you have a bad RAM stick. Phantom parity errors - show up on systems that don&apos;t have parity or ECC memory. If Windows generates parity erros with different addreseses, mostly likely do not have a problem with  RAM. Can occur for variety of reasons, including software proble,ms, heat or dust, etc. 

System lockups and page faults can indicate problem wiht RAM.

System lockup - when computer stops functioning. 

Page fault - milder eroor that can be cause by memory issues but not necessarily system RAM problems. Look like RAM issues because Windows generates error messages with long hex digits. If same address repeats, then probably have problem with RAM otherwise problem is likely something else. 

Non-maskable interrupt (NMI) - panic button in PC. Defined as an interruption the CPU cannot ignore. Manifests as a proprietary crash screen. Called Blue Screen of Death. 

Intermittent memory errors can come from variety of sources, inclduing dying power supply, electrical interference, bugggy apps, buggy hardware, etc. Show up as lockups, general protection faults, page faults, and parity errors, but never have same address or happen with same applications.</Answer>

					<Question>What is virtual memory?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Virtual Memory - computers use a portion of hard drive as extension of system RAM, through what&apos;s called virtual m
emory. Portion of hard drrive or solid state drive set aside as hat&apos;s called a *page file* or *swap file*. When co
mputer starts running out of real RAM because too many program loaded, the system swaps programs from RAM to page 
file, opening more space for programs currently active.

					<Question>How does virtual memory work in Windows?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Windows virtual memory starts by creating a page file that resides on hard drive. Page file works like temporary s
torage box. Windows rmeoves running programs temporarily from RAM into page file so other programs can load and ru
n. Only used when RAM is full. Least used program typically taken from RAM and stored in page file. Program in pag
e file when trying to be used will then be loaded back into RAM.

					<Question>What is Serial Presence Detect?</Question>
					<Answer>Serial Presence Detect (SPD) - mobo should detect and automatically set up and DIMM installed. RAM makers ad chip to modern sticks called SPD chip. SPD chip soters all information about DRAm including size, speed, ECC, or non-ECC, registered or unregistered and number of others bits of info. When PC boots, it queries SPD chip so that MCC knows how much RAM is on stick, how fast it runs, and other information. All new systems count on SPD to set RAM timings properly for system when it boots. RAM stick with bad SPD chip will get POST error message nd system won&apos;t boot.</Answer>
