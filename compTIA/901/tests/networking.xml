					<Question>What is a frame?</Question>
					<Answer>Frame - data moved from one device to a another in discrete chunks called frames. Chunks stored roughly about 1500 bytes of data each. Data must be broken up into individual frames to send. Nothing but a series of 1s and 0s. First flashes tell device that frame is coming. Then data. Ending tells device that&apos;s all there is. Really binary data. On fiber optic, it&apos;s 1s and 0s. In copper, its voltages going up and down. If wireless, its frequencies being changed</Answer>

					<Question>What is a HUB?</Question>
					<Answer>HUB - repeater. Device sends frame into hub. Hub reads frame and makes copies for every connection in hub. Sends copies down wires to every other computer i network.

HUB - 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps. Problem is every two computers talking to each other on same HUB will eat the bandwidth. If have 2 pairs of computers talking to each other in 100Mbps speed, bandwidth drops to 50Mbps.</Answer>

					<Question>How did networking work with hubs, frames, and MAC Addresses?</Question>
					<Answer>At beginning of frame put destination MAC address (where want data to go to) and source MAC address (where its coming from). 

HUB still makes copy for all computers on network. Every computer gets copy of that frame. When computer receives incoming frame, it looks at two-part MAC address. If its for device, it sends it to OS. Otherwise, it erases it.</Answer>

					<Question>What is a switch?</Question>
					<Answer>Switch - replaced HUBs. Switches are very smart. Look like HUBs. Keeps track of MAC addresses of computers hooked to it based on ports. Takes frame, checks MAC Address, sends it to port with device with that MAC address. Other connections do not see frame at all. Other devices are able to work at full bandwidth of switch. 

Can still broadcast. Handle broadcasts like HUB. Switch throws notations out window and acts like a HUB.</Answer>

					<Question>What is structured cabling?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Set of standards. TIA/EIA set standards from type of cabling to use to standard on running cables in walls and position of wall outlets. 

Idea is to create a safe, reliable cabling infrastructure for all of the devices that may need interconnection. Applies to copmuter networks but also to telephone, video, anything that might need low power, distributed cabling. 

Successful structure cabling requires three essential ingredients: a telecommunications room, horizontal cabling, and a work area. 

Telecommunications room: - all cabling runs from individual workstations to a central location. All cables concentrate in this one area. 

Equipment racks - devices that fit in racks use standard height measurement called U. A U is 1.75 inches. So device that fits in 1.75 inch space is 1U. Device that takes 3.5 inches is 2U, etc. 

Horizontal cabling - all cables run horizontally for most part from telecom rom to workstations. Single piece of installed horizontal cabling is called a run. 

Work area - opposite end of horizontal cabling from telecom room. Often simly an office or cublicle.

Physically connecting computers together to make a network is straight forward process. However some issues that motivate people to use structured cabling. 

Where to put cables? 

Wall outlet - uses a special jack designed to plug into a network cable

Patch panel - oter end of *horizontal run*. Usually near switch. Once in place, horizonal run is never touched for years. As a result, can count on it to work and be safe. Simply a box wit ha row of female connectors (ports) in front and permanent connections in the back to which you connect horizontal cables. 

Most common uses a special type of connector called a 110 block or a 110 punchdown block. Connect to a 110block using a punchdown tool.  

Available in wide variety of configurations that include different types of ports nad number of ports. Can get UTP, STP, or fiber ports. Come with CAT ratings. 

Patch cables - runs from patch panel into switch. Then another patch cable runs from wall outlet into computer.  Short (two to five foot) UTP cables. Stranded rather than solid.

					<Answer>CAT 5 - CAT levels are important because different qualities of UTP cable can handle larger amounts of data. Need right type of UTP for speed of network you have. All other pieces get CAT rating as well, such as patch panels. 

CAT 5 - designed to run 100Mbps Ethernet networks. Was great, but problem was that patch panels and little crimps didn&apos;t.</Answer>

					<Question>Describe the TIA/EIA 568 standards</Question>
					<Answer>IA/EIA 568 Standards

TIA/EIA 568 A

TIA/EIA 568 B - 

Difference between A and B. If punching into jack or patch panel, there is color coding on it that makes things simple. 

When making own patch cables, gets more copmlicated. 

Stripping off insulation from cable, can see all 4 pairs of cabling.

Blues and Browns never move. Brown usually oriented to one side (facing away, the right side. Looking at it, the left). The blue always stays in center. The split oranges or split greens. Oranges split between blue. Green comes before orange so A (alphabetical). Always something white, solid, something white, solid, etc. Kevlar in wire to give tension strength. 

Make it flat shape, then cut. 

Crimp - the plastic connection at end of wire. Make sure crimp is on bottom. Make sure its all in right order, and make sure all wires have gone all the way up into the top.

Crimper - Use crimper. And should have made first real connection. 

For B, orange stays in front and split the greens. 

110 Punchdown Tool - used to punch down all 8 wires individually. A says start with green, then orange, then brown, then blue. But doesn&apos;t matter cause internal people will make sure wires are correct.</Answer>

					<Question>What are fiber optic cables?</Question>
					<Answer>Not as commong as UTP but very important. 

Fiber Optic - Uses light instead of electricity. Can be very long. Can be 40KM. Depending on standard. Impervious to Electromagnetic interference. Laser light version (laser diodes genreate laser light) and regular light that use light-emitting diodes (LEDs generate visible and infrared light). Different cable for each. 

Single mode - designed specifically for transmitting lasers

Multi-mode - transmits regular light. More common, cheaper, and slower. 

Not just plugging one cable into network card or into switch. Always come in pairs. One connector for sending and one for receiving.

Duplex cable - two cables fused together. 

Hundreds of fiber optics connectors. A+ covers three.

ST - round connector. Stick in and twist it. One of oldest

SC - Stick it in and click. Squareish connector. 

Both around for decades. Because always running duplex, the connectors were very large.

LC - Local connector - Alot smaller and takes less space</Answer>

					<Question>What is coaxial cable?</Question>
					<Answer xml:space="preserve">Coaxial - Around for very long time. Called coax because more than one connection that shared an access. So conductor, then insulator that separates it from another conductor. At least 2 conductors. Can be more. Consists of center cable (core) surrounded by insulation. This in turn i scovered with a shield of braided cable. Center core carried signal and shield effectively eliminated outside interference.

RG value (radio grade) - different RG talk about different types of coax.

RG6 - used to connect cable to cable modem

RG59 - used to connect old TV boxes. Thinner and doesn&apos;t carry data quite as far.

Both impedence set to 75 ohms.

					<Answer>MAC Address - Media Access Control - burned in to network card. Comes from manufacturer. Always 12 hex values separated into pairs. First half of address, so first 6 values, assigned to particular manufacturer. Every device has unique MAC address. 48 bits long, so 6 bytes. 

At beginning of frame put destination MAC address (where want data to go to) and source MAC address (where its coming from). MAC Addresses are for NICs. 

Also need type of data check to verify data was received correctly. Cyclic Redundancy Check - CRC. Math algorithms to check data.</Answer>

Can connect multiple smaller networks into a bigger network turing a group of LANs into one big WAN. 

Computer needs powerful, flexible addressing to address a frame so that it goes to a copmuter within its own LAn or to a computer on another LAN on the same WAN. This process is routing, requires routig and routing-capable protocol.
