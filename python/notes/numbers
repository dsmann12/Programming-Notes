NUMBERS

Integers and Floating point. 

Floating point can also be 4E2 = (4 * 10 ^ 2)

In Python 2, it is integer division by default. In Python 3, it is true division.

In 2, just specify floating pont to do real division. Or cast numbers to be a float.

float(3)/2
1.5

3/2
1 // python 2

3/2
1.5 // python 3

__future__ => module to import python 3 capailities into Python 2

from __future__ import division

3/2
1.5

** - exponentiation operator

2**3 = 8
5**2 = 25

4**0.5 = 2 // square root

Order of operations
2 + 10 * 10 + 3 = 105

Can use parentheses as well. 

Assignment is simple

a = 5

Names of objects cannot start with a number, have spaces, or use certain symbols. Best practice that names are lowercase
