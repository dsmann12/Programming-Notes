Getting input:

Must create variable to store input value. 

char name[20]; //Name shouldn't have more than 20 chars
int age;

printf("Enter your name: \n");
scanf("%s", name); //store %s string in varaible name
printf("What is your age?\n");
scanf("%d", &age); //For basic type variables (non-pointers), must use & to get address of variable

scanf -- allows formatted input to be read
