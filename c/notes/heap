Heap

Variables reserve memory on computer. That's what program has access to. 
Up to this point, memory that program allowed to use was limited by variables
declared. 

What if you need more memory than variables reserve?

Heap is leftover memory that computer is not using. Like extra memory you can
borrow. Can access it with program, do what you want to do with it, then give
it back to computer when done with it. 

sizeof(basic type) -- returns number of bytes basic type holds on a system
sizeof(int) = 4 in 32 bit systems. = 8 in 64 bit systems

malloc - allocate memory from heap

int * points;
points = (int *) malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); //convert to int* so it will store ints

free(points); //frees memory back to heap. Otherwise it will continue to store values

can use it to expand arrays
