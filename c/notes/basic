main() function essential to every program. Whenever program is run, computers looks for main().
Starts and stops in brackets of main. Every line can contain an instruction. Each instruction 
ends in (;).

int main() {} 

return 0; -- main functions specifies it must return an int. Return function returns int 0.

Pre-Processor Directives:

#include -- C has many built-in functions. Standard libraries. This tells program to include 
those files to get these functions. Linker links all code together for executable.

whitespace is ignored. Only for readability.  

// -- comments. Ignored by compiler. Used for explaining code. Only comments one line
/* */ -- comments all text between the special characters

Variables are placeholders for another value. Compiler sets of memory and stores value in an 
address. Must have name. Name cannot start with underscore or number. No spaces. Also do not name
 variables same name as function. Must have a type. 

int age; // age is variable that stores an int value  
age = 24; // = is assignment operator. Assigns value 24 to int variable age
age = 2016 - 1992; // age is result of 2016 - 1992 converted to int

Basic Types

int
char
float
double
long
long long

unsigned
signed

int can hold char values, etc.

isalpha(int) //checks if value is a letter
isdigit(int) //checks if value is a digit 

Strings - An array of characters (char) values.Must end will a null terminator. Tells compiler that reached the end of string. 

"String\0"

Array length must include whitespace and null character.

Array is a series of data of the same type. Stored in memory sequentially. Can be accessed with integer offset index. 
Index multipled by starting memory location of array to find correct memory sequence containing valye. 
Index begins at 0 and goes to n - 1 with n being the size of the array. Must set size of array upon initialization if it
does not have an initial value. If it does have initial value, then size does not need to be delcared. 

int array[1];
array[0] = 0;

char string[] = "String"; //automatically generates correct size array. (7 -- 6 letters + null character)
string[0]; // 'S'

String has its own functions. Own header called String.h

strcpy(dest string, source string); 
strcpy(string, "NewString!"); //string now equals "NewString!"

Math Operators:


Integer Math

Conditionals:

if-else statements

Ternary operator:

(test) ? trueCode: falseCode; //if (test) == true then trueCode, else falseCode

loops

break // keyword that lets you break out of loop before it is finished
continue // keyword that stops loops execution, and returns to beginning of loop

switch: //If condition met, then go to certain block of code to execute


switch() {
	case 1:
		printf("1!\n");
		break;
	case 2:
		printf("2!\n");
		break;
	case 2:
		printf("3!\n");
		break
	default:
		printf("Not from 1-3!\n");
	
}
