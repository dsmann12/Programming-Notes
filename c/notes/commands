strcat(String dest, str src) //tack on one string to other string
strcpy() //copy string into other string. Automatically sets size.

scanf() ends at whitespace

puts()
gets(String) //reads a line from stdin into buffer pointed to by s until
either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with null char.
No check for overrun is performed.

//dangerous. Because no overrun check. Impossible to tell how many
characters gets() will read and will continue to store chars past end 
of buffer. Has been used to break computer security. 

Use fgets() instead. 

fgets()
feof()

floor(float) //rounds floating point number down to nearest whole number. Truncates decimals
ceil(float) //rounds floating point up to next whole number. Truncates decimals
