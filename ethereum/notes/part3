PART 3 LOTTERY

Contract will have a prize pool and a list of people who have enetered

Imagine player1, player2. Both can send in some amount of money as contract. As soon as they have, they will be recorded as players.

Ether will be held in prize pool of sorts. 

A third party (manager) will tell contract to pick a winner. Contract is picking. Contract will pick winner, send money, and reset.

BASIC SOLIDITY TYPES

address -> type for address meant for storing addresses.
string -> string type
bool -> boolean value
int -> integer, positive or negative
uint - unsigned int.
fixed/ufixed - fixed point number. decimal. Like float

int is int256. Same with uint. Can use different factors of 8 to determine precision.

int8 - int256
uint8 - uint256

Pay for storage so using larger sizes costs more.
