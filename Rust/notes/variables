VARIABLE BINDINGS

Variable bindings - bind some value to a name. 

let - used to introduce a binding

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
}

Similar to variables in other languages, but have more features. 

Left-hand side of let statement is a 'pattern', not variable name. 

Allows:

let (x, y) = (1, 2);

Type Annotations:

Rust is statically typed, means specify types up front and they are checked at compile time. 

So why does above statement compile?

Rust has *type inference*. Can figure out what type something is without explicit declaration. 

Can add type. Use colon (:):

let x: i32 = 5;

x is bindining with type i32 and value five. 

Rust has many different primitive integer types. Begin with i for signed, u for unsigned. Possible sizes are 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits. 

MUTABILITY

By default, binding are *immutable*. 

let x = 5;
x = 10;

Causes ERROR. 

mut - must be used to make a binding mutable

let mut x = 5;
x = 10;

Default immutable for safety. Compiler will catch if value is attempted to be changed informing developer if they meant for binding to be mutable. 

INITIALIZING BINDINGS

Bindings are required to be initialized with a value before they can be used. 

If binding not used, code will still run and compile. If is used though, program will not compile. 

fn main() {
    let x: i32;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}

Will not work.

Also, if include two curly braces {} in string to print, Rust will interpret this as request to interpolate some value. 

String interpolation is computer science term that means "stick in middle of a string".

When using curly braces, Rust will attempt to display value in meaningful way by checking out its type. If want to specify format in more detailed manner, wide number of options, 

std::fmt

SCOPE AND SHADOWING

Scope is defined by {}. 

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 17;
    {
        let y: i32 = 3;
        println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y);
    }
    println!("The value of x is {} and value of y is {}", x, y); // This won't work.
}


Variable bindings can be shadowed. Means a later variable binding with same name as another binding that is currently in scope will override previous binding. 

Shadowing distinct from mutability. For one, can rebind name to value of a different type. Also possible to change mutability of a binding.  Also shadowing a name does not alter or destory value it was bound to. Value exists until variable goes out of scope. 

let mut x: i32 = 1;
x = 7;
let x = x; // `x` is now immutable and is bound to `7`.

let y = 4;
let y = "I can also be bound to text!"; // `y` is now of a different type.

Shadowing different than marking variable as mut, cause we'll geta compile time error if accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using let. Using let, can perform a few transformations on a value but have variable be immutable after those transformatino have been completed. 

Because we are essentially creating a new variable when use let keywrod again, we can change type of the value but reuse the same name. 

let spaces = "    ";
let spaces = spaces.len();

Does not work with mut

let mut spaces = "    ";
spaces = spaces.len(); // does not work

CONSTANT

Different than immutable. Regular variables can be declared mutable. Constants nver can. 

Use const keyword. 

Type must be annotated. 

const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000

Constants can only be set to a constant expression, not to result of a fcuntion or any other value that could only be computed at runtime. 

STATEMENTS vs EXPRESSIONS

Expressions return values, statements do not.

let y = 6; // statement. Does not return value
let z = (let a = 5); // not valid. Does not return value
