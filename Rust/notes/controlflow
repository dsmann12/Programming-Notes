IF EXPRESSIONS

let number = 3;

if number < 5 {
	println!("condition was true");
} else {
	println!("condition was false");
}

Blocks of code to be executed are sometimes called arms like with match expressions. 

Condition must be a bool! Cannoy just use a value.

//ERROR
if number {}

ELSE IF

let number = 6;

if number % 4 == 0 {
	
} else if number % 3 == 0 {

} else if number % 2 == 0 {

} else {

}

Can use if in a let statement because it is an expression. 

let number = if condition {
	5 
} else {
	6
};

Basically ternery operator. 

Types in each branch must match. 

Loops

loop {
	if condition = 1 {
		break;
	}
}

Repeats until it is told to break. 

While loops

while number != 0 {

}

Loops while condition is true

For loops allows for looping through an iterable collection.

let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for element in a.iter() {
	println!("the value is {}", element);
}

Can also loop through a range

for number in (1..4) {
	// 1 to 4
}

for number in (1..4).rev() {
	// 4 to 1
}
