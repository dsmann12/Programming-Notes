DATABASES

Database - a collection of information/data that comes with an interface for interacting with data

SQL - language for interfacing with some databases. Relational databases. Databases are tabular and flat

USERS TABLE
id | name | age | city
----------------------
1  | Tim  |	57  | New York City

COMMENTS TABEL
id	|	text
----------------------
1	|	"lol"
2	| 	"Come visit Montana!"
3	| 	"I love puppies!"
4	|	"Seriously, Montana is great!"

USER/COMMENTS JOIN TABLE
userId	|	commentId
-------------------------
	1	|	3
	2	|	2
	2	|	4
	3	| 	1

Join table - to arrange data from two different tables. 

Not very flexible. If need to add a new field, must add field to all entries and give a NULL or empty file. 

NoSql - not sql. Non-relational. 

MongoDB 

db.dogs.find()
db.dogs.delete({age: 14}); //delete all dogs aged 14

{
	name: "Ira",
	age: 24, 
	city: Missoula,
	comments: [
		{text: "Come visit Montana!"},
		{text: "Seriously, Montana is great!"}
	],
	favColor = "blue"
}

Can add fields on the fly and not for every entry. 

SQL is often better than No-Sql, but No-Sql is OK in places.
