DATA ASSOCIATIONS

Associations - multiple collections being related to one another. 

Different types of associations:

one:one - simplest. One entity related to one of another entity. One book has one publisher
one:many - one entity is related to many of another entity. One user has many photos. 
many:many - many entities are related to many other entities. Many students have many courses. 

EMBEDDING DATA

Embed data in object as an array or list.

Then push data to that array or list. 

Referencing Data

Reference id of another object in other databases. Have array of those IDs in object.

Usually one style or the other is better depending on what you are doing. 

MODULE.EXPORT

Modularize code to split it into files based on functionality and similarities. 

var User = mongoose.model("User", userScheme);
module.exports = User;

Exports an object that can be referenced in another JS file with require.

var User = require("./models/user");
