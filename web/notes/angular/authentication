AUTHENTICATION

Works different for traditional web app and a SPA (single page app). 

Traditional:

Client (Frontend)
What user sees
Receives finished HTML code


Server (Backend)
Views, HTML dynamically generated by server
Uses template engine often to render views

Client sends auth information to server. Server checks it (validates). If valid, it creates a session ans stores session on server. 
Session stores on server in database. Client gets sessions cookie, which contains ID of session. Then can be sent with every request to check cookie and session. 

SPA (Angular): Not as strong connection
Client:
One page. 
Changes HTML dynamically here
Still sends auth information
Client simply attached token to requests. 

Server:
Server checks auth information for validity. 
If valid, will not create session. Does not remember client.
Still want to give something to inform server user is logged in. 
Sends back a JSON Web Token that encodes some information about the authenticated user and is hashed with certain algorithm and secret only known to server. 

Read about JWT specifically the intro.

Probably use a service to send request for authentication data and receive token in response. And must store token in local storage manually.
