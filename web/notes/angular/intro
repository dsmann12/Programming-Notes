ANGULAR

JavaScript framework hwich allows you to create reactive Single Page Applications. Changes happen on client 
side during runtime. Not making http requests. Just one HTML file. 

Angular 1 - first version.
Angular 2 - rewrite. Not much in common with 1. Was future
Angular 4 - update to Angular 2 but common with 1

Angular CLI - used to setup Angular. Angular uses TypeScript so must be compiled before browser uses. 

npm install -g @angular/cli

ng new <project name>
ng new my-first-app

ng serve - builds all source code (typescript). Then spins up development server.

Navigate to the correct port on localhost to check it worked. 

Folder structure:

Most files are for configuring project

e2e - end to end testing

src - where you create your project. 

src/index.html is single page that will be served

src/app = folder where create app. 

app.component.ts - exports title 'app works'

ng server - watches files for changes and automatically changes pages in browser.

app.component.html - html template

To add input.

In regular JS, have to add a listener and find p element to get text and dislay.

In angular:

<input type=text [(ngModel)]="name"> //angular command. Sets up binding. Binds to property of ts file. 
<p>{{ name }}</p>

in component.ts

name = ''

So webpage dynamically changes text in p tags according to what is typed in the input textbox.

Add name property to app.component.ts file. 

Updates in real time.

TypeScript - superset to JS. Classes, interfaces, and types. Has to be compiled into JS. CLion.

Can add Bootstrap. 

npm install bootstrap --save

Then open .angular-cli.json file. 

Scroll to styles:
Allows imports of global style sheets
Already supplies styles.css which is empty file
Reference node_modules folder which holds all downloaded repositories

"styles": [
	"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
	"styles.css"
],

Behind the scenes, the CLI uses Webpack, a tool which bundles all JS and CSS files and adds them to the index.html file

Can also adjust project, like changing title for index.html.
