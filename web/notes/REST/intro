Representational State Transfer 

REST - a mapping between HTTP routes and CRUD. Pattern for defining routes

CREATE
READ	/allBlogs
UPDATE	/updateBlod/:id
DESTROY	/destroyBlog/:id
SHOW
EDIT
INDEX
NEW

Nested Routes are possible. 

If the new structure is connected to another, then it should be nested in that other structure's 
route path.
