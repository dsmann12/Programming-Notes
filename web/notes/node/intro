NODE.JS

Node - the trendy JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and 
efficient. Package ecosystem, npm, is largest ecosystem of open source libraries in world. 

Used to only be able to run JS in a browser. Was only front-end code. Couldn't do anything in server side. 

Node is a way to write JS code on server side. cd 

Is popular among existing developers. 

Great libraries, high performance, and open source. Also in JavaScript. Don't have to learn peculiarities of Ruby or PHP. 

Can also use PHP for similar services. 

USING NODE

Use Node Console and run files with node. 

node - command to start node interpreter. Basically a JS console. 

4+10 will return 14

"Hello"+" World" will return 'HELLO WORLD'

REPL - read evaluate print loop. 

DOM does not exist in node. No document object or alert() function. 

Can create a JS file and execute it in command line by using node command.

node <filename>

Like regular coding but in JS.

NPM

npm - node package manager. 

Had to use script tag in HTML to include libraries in HTML. No script tag in backend. Get libraries through npm. Called packages. 

npm install <package name>

npm installs packages into a folder called node_modules/ whenever a package is created. 

require('id') -> imports a package

var soemthing = require('cat-me'); //searches for package called 'cat-me' in folder.
