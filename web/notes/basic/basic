WEB BASICS

Understand how internet works at high level
Understand difference between front end and back end
Understand html and how to view html on any website

PC asks server for a copy of a webpage. Sticks request in virtual "envelope" called a packet. 
Wrapped with specific information about request including website's IP address.

Computer sends packet via large underground wire, passing through regional networks before getting into main Internet hub. 
IP address tells hub that server is somewhere. 

Hub sends packet as light across fiber optic cables (even across ocean). 

Packet ends up at other Internet hub. Sends packet through series of regional networks to server location.

Server reads request and prepared to send webpage to pc. Web pages are large though and cannot be sent at once, made up of images and text. 

Server is pulverized into thousands of tiny packets of data. Each wrapped with all info it needs to rebuild webpage. Sent to local hub. 

Local hub checks traffic report before sending them off. Travel through miles of land checking in a different hubs. Must get to pc fast as possible.

All happens in about a second. 

Internet a network of networks.

Findinf the Right Address:

-Query is submitted to ISP
-Whithin ISP, DNS takes the domain name and turns it into an IP Address 

Going To The Address
-A request is sent to desired IP address via HTTP
-Request finds fastest path to sever with specified IP
-Not a direct journey, requires hopping from sever to server

- Requestsed server figures out what user was exactly asking for.
-Server builds us the right content, often pulling information from database
-Server responds with any combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
-Browser takes info and makes it easy to read for humans

View Page Source
-Can view underlying HTML, CSS, and Javascript on any webpage
-In chrome, right click and select "ViewPage Source"
