AUTHENTICATION

Pretty complicated. A lot of things that have to work. 

Lots of tools. 

passport.js - used to implement authentication for node.js

Can do local authnetication or use facebook, twitter, google authentication. 
Multiple "strategies". 

Passport Local - strategy for local authentication

Passport Local Mongoose - made to work with mongoose. Makes things faster and simpler.

HTTP - stateless protocol. Requests are one time things and don't contain information
about history and states. 

Sessions - provide state for requests. Passport sees it on server and unlocks it to
figure out state. 

Express-Sessions - used to implement sessions in Express

Stores a salt and a hash in a user object
