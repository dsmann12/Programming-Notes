Understand "general rule" for CSS syntax

Cascading Style Sheet - the adjectives

Stylize a website.

Seprate from HTML. Included by HTML.

css Zen Garden - useful website

General Rule:

selector {
	property: value;
	anotherProperty: value;
}

Examples:

//Make all h1s purple and 56px font

h1 {
	color: purple;
	font-size: 56px;
}

//Give all imags a 3 px border

img {
	border-color: red;
	border-width: 3px;
}

Where Write Styles?

Can do inline:

<h3 style="color: pink;">blah blah blah </h3>
<p style=:"color: yellow;">blah blah blah</p>

Or Style Tag

<html>
<head>
	<title>About Rust</title>
	<style type="text/css">
		li {
			color: red;
		}
	</style>
</head>

THESE ARE BAD IDEAS! Must duplicate any changes you want to make for every element. 

Separation good for modularity. 

Best to write CSS in separate CSS file
Use <link> tag to include file in CSS

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Demo Page</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="app.css">
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>

app.css

h1 {
	color: purple;
}

h3 {
	color: pink;
}

MDN Element Reference

Element selector - selects by element

With conflicting style implementations, last one is used.

href - gives pathname of file to look for css.

Put link tags and styles in head. Point of head is to put stuff that has to do with elements but are not elements.

COLORS IN CSS

color: red;
color: blue;

Probably will not use this. Usually want a specific color, even created ones. 

color: cornflowerBlue;
color: darkOrchid

147 different colors. 

colours.neilorangepeel.com

Other Color Systems:

heaxadecimal: string of 6 hex numbers (0-F)

color: #000000; black
color: #4B0082; purple
color: #FF1493; pinkish

First two numbers correspond to how much red, next correspond to green, next correspond to blue. 

#FF0000; //red
#00FF00; //green
#0000FF; //blue

RGB slightly different than mixing colors. 

#FFFFFF; //white

Most time not coming up with colors from scratch. Not skill. Have color picker. Online or built in. 

RGB - similar. 

Red, Green, And Blue. Each ranches from 0-255. 

color: rgb(0, 255, 0); //green
color: rgb(100, 0, 100); //purple
color: rgb(11, 99, 150); //shade of blue

RGBA - just like RGB but include transparency. Range from 0.0 - 1.0

color: rgba(11, 99, 150, 1);
color: rgba(11, 99, 150, .6);
color: rgba(11, 99, 150, .2);

A stands for alpha. 

COLOR AND BACKGROUND

Use color to set text color and background for background color

body {
	background: #95a5a6;
}

Can also use backgroun property to set a background image. e

body {
	background: url(https://www.url.com/image);
}

Automatically tiled. 

body {
	background: url(https://www.url.com/image);
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: cover;
}

HOW GET A BORDER

Border in css has three different parts. Width, color, style.

h1 {
	border-color: #FF0000;
	border-width: 5px;
	border-style: solid;
	
	or

	border: 5px solid purple;
	border: 8px dashed purple;
}

CSS SELECTORS

	property: value;
}

Element Selector:

30 CSS Selectors Must Memorize

Other Selectors:

Star Selector:

Selects everything on page. Wild card

* {

}

Descendant Selector:

Takes two or more selectors if chained together. Select all anchor tags descended from another elemet

Every anchor tag in a li:

li a {
	color: red;
}

Adjacent Selector:

Select elements that come after another element. NOT NESTED INSIDE> 

h4 + ul {
	color: blue;
}
 
Attribute Selector:

Select based on attribute

All inputs of a particular type. All href links to google. Or all images of a particular source. 

a[href="https://www.google.com"] {
	background: blue;
}

input[type="text"] {
	color: red;
}

Nth of types:

Select every nth element. Every 5th div, or 3rd p

ul:nth-of-type(3) {
	background: purple;
}

This selects every 3rd li element in a list. 
li:nth-of-type(3) {
	background: purple;
}

li:nth-of-type(even) {
	background: purple;
}

INHERITANCE and SPECIFICITY

Nested elements may inherit properties from parent elements. 

body {
	color: red;
}

Even ul or ol and li in them are red. 

ul {
	color: blue;
}

All li in a ul are blue as well. 

Specificity - style selected for specific attribute is applied even if there is inherited values. Multiple styles can target one element. 

Specificity Calculator 

Type selectors - least specific
Class, attribute, and psuedo-class selectors - medium specific
id selectors - most specific
