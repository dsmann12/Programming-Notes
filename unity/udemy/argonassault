CREATE TERRAIN

GameObject > Terrain

Use tools to edit terrain. 

Change resolution to make it bigger or smaller. 

Can go to terrain set height and click flatten to put whole terrain t that height.

Then can dig alleys. 

Opacity is how quickly it raises or lowers. 

Terrain will be shared with multiple levels. Therefore, editing it will change multiple levels.
To get around this, make terrains or each level as needed.

TEXTURE TERRAIN

Go to asset store.

Textures andmaterials.

Rock textures. 

24 PBR mats for Unity 5. 

Go to terrain > paint textures

Click edit textures.

Albedo and Normal.

Albedo is fox texture. Normal is for adding 3D quality. 

Ensure texture type is normal map.

Bump map : texture with information on ow light catches a shape. Tells where bumps are
Height map: uses white to black scale to show height. Can export height map as raw. 
Normal map: uses RGB values to indicate xyz facing direction. Where pixel is facing. 

Can also change texture size to make details bigger or smaller.


Change scale of texture to change how it looks. 

Can change metallicness and smoothness in edit texture window

SKYBOX

Asset > Right Click > Create Material

Tell it it is a skybox procedural shader. Procedural like default, has a ground plane and sky tint. Changing ccolor changes sky and can partially change lighting.

Assets Store

Skybox Vol 2

Change skybox to six sided. So you put six sides of cube and they will blend together to loo spherical.

Skubox have Front, Back, Left, Right, Up, and Down textures

These are already created in the assets. 

Drag this full texture onto scene to replace skybox.

PERFORMANCE

Can increase pixel error in terrain settings to increase performance. Lowers fidelity. 

Can also change map distance render in base terrain settings


ADD PLAYER SHIP

Can mess with terrrain settings to increase performance.

Modulat Spacesip 1" StarSparrow

Put pivot point in central position and prefab it. 

SPLASH SCREEN

Just looks at sky box, music plays, then scene is loaded. 

Make this a scene. 

Make music play and then load scene

PERSIST MUSIC

UNITYS WAYPOINT UTILITY SCRIPTS

For doing a camera fly through

Exisitng asset pack from Unity 2017. 

Import standard asset packages.


Utility ->
WaypointCircuit
WaypointProgressTracker

Click Y and then double click on terrain to get overhead view.

Create new game object called Circuit.
Then give it child objects (waypoints)

On Circuit add a Waypoint Circuit script.
Add object to it. 
Then you can see them and smooth out the track. Can't change thickness of line at this point. 

Using interface may not be best way to use them. Maybe better to 

Add WayPointProgressTracker to camera
Make main camera the target. Add circuit to ProgressTracker. 

Put between 5-10 waypoints for path so it is not too jerky. 

USING CROSS PLATFORM INPUT

Acts as a middle layer between keyboard/gamepad/mouse and game. So that multiple inputs can be used and supported. 

Move ship as child of camera and move it forward.

Import CrossPlaytormInput package from standard assets

using UnityStandardAssets.CrossPlatformInput;;

CrossPlatformInpuManager refers to everything as axes. 

float horizontalThrow = CrossPlatformInputManager.GexAxis("Horizontal");

CrossPlatformInpuManager refers to everything as axes. Also has buttons instead of keys

Editor > Project Settings > Input -> where you can change input amanager

In this input manager, there is one Horizontal axis using a and b and left and right. But there is also another that uses  a joystick from a gamepad. 

Unity uses gravity and sensitivity settings to move values from 0 to +/- 1 so that it performs similar to a joystick. A joystick determines if it is -1 or 1 itsel by how far it is moved. 

Even can use this to use on screen joystick.

INPUT SENSITIVITY AND GRAVITY

Will calculate x offset depending on framerate to move a certain amount per frame. Isn't this bad?

Sensitivity determines how long it takes to get throw to +/-1. Basically the slope in a graph where throw is y and time is x. 

Drop down back to 0 according to gravity setting. 

Get capped speed that ship will move left and right. Multiply this by throw to get speed it should move. 

Get xOffset. 

float xOffsetThisFrame = horizontalThrow * xSpeed * Time.deltaTime;

Mathf.Clamp() TO RESTRICT MOVEMENT

float rawNewXPos = transform.localPosition.x + xOffset;
transform.localpositoin = new Vector3(rawNewXPos, transform.localposition.y, transform.localposition.z)

Use Mathf.Clamp to keep object from moving too much.

pos = Mathf.Clamp(rawPos, -10f, 10f);

UNDERSTANDING ROLL, PITCH, AND YAW

Ship is always aiming at center of screen which isn't fun so should rotate it. 

Rotation in x > pitch
rotation in y > yaw
Rotation in z > roll

Adjust pitch, yaw, roll so that as you move to four corners of box you aim at corners of screen. 

HOW TO SET LOCAL ROTATION

Order of transformations matters.

Do Translation
Then Do rotation

Rotations use quaternions by default. Difficult subject. 

Use transform.localRotation

transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(x, y, z);

Have controlPitchFactor(-30) and positionPitchFactor(-5)
positionYawFactor(5)

controlPitch is to move nose up if on bottom and down if on top.

float pitchDueToPosition = transform.localPosition.y * positionPitchFactor;
float pitchDueToControlThrow = yThrow * controlPitchFactor;
float pitch = pitchDueToPosition.x * positionYawFactor
float yaw = transform.localPosition.x * positionYawFactor;
float roll = xThrow * controlRollFactor;
transform.localRotation = Quaternion.Euler(pitch, yaw, roll);

Translation:

xThrow = CrossPlatormInputManager.GetAxis("Horizontal");
yThrow = CrossPLayformInputManager.GetAxis("Vertical");

float xOffset = xThrow * speed * Time.deltaTime;
float yOffset = yThrow * speed * Time.deltaTime;

float rawX = transform

Movement		Position On Screen			Control Throw
Pitch			Coupled						Coupled
Yaw				Coupled						-
Roll			-							Coupled

TWEAK AND TUNE

Change lookahead and camera FOV to fix things

CREATE BULLET PARTICLES

Use particle system for bullets

Look at texture being applied to particles in Renderer tab. 

Drag particle materials from asset pack.

Select material for particles. Use the square

Reduce angle down to 0.

Reduce radius to 0.01

Maybe change from code. 

Can then see where player is pointing. 

Duration is for how long particles are emitted for.

Can make small duration so bullets are infrequent.

In Emission, change rate. to 3.

Change start lifetime and start speed to further range of shots

Change Simulation space from local to world so bullets don't move with ship

Can also add a trail. 

Go to trails section. Go to renderer and check square material. 

Change lifetime of trail. Width of trail. And maybe even size of particles at start so only trail is seen.

EXPLOSION PARTLES AND SFX

Create gameobject named explosion and give it particle system.
Also get sound effect. 

Make particle system a sphere shape and make length low. High start speed. Start lifetime like 0.2.

Go to renderer and give it a material. 

Can choose start color and if click on right most area in interface you can make a gradient.Can add colors for gradient. Add orange in red and yellow to look like explosion.

Can click new to save gradient as preset. 

Defaiult is blending. Can make them fixed so there is no blend.

Can make number random of two constantsso you can add randomization to explosion.
Can also randomize size.

DODGE AND SHOOT

Add obstacles and ships or player to shoot. 

Can add obstacles to a game object. 

TIDYING

In Window > Lighting, if Auto Generate is clicked, then lighting will be baked again after terrain is changed which can be intensive. If unclicked, you need to regenerate lighting.

Make checklist when tidying a project.  

TRIGGERS AND COLLISIONS

Look at project boost code to see how handled collision. 

There's a table for collisoins. 

Triggers don't process physics. 

Rigidbody is needed for physics 

**PREFAB - can reset prefab by dragging the one in the scene 

Static doesn't move.

Kinematic moves but not by physics engine. 

Can also mark an object as static to denote that it doesn't move so Unity doesn't calculate physics with it. 

SendMessage() BETWEEN COMPONENTS

Make Component that control player. PlayerController.

But to handle collisions make another component. 

CollisionHandler()

[Header("General"] -> gives bold header on interface

Actor moel -> 

SebdNessage("MethodName") - calls the methods called MethodName() on all other scripts on the same game object. 

Also broadcastMessage and broadcast message upwards. 

Have StartDeathSequence() called in OnTriggerEnter() in Collision Handler. 

Then can have handler tell control to disable controls. 

ENABLE A GAMEOBJECT FROM C#

Ensure particles and audio play on awake. 

Hava areference t othe gameObject
Use deathFx.SetActive(true);

SINGLETON PATTERN WITHOUT STATICS

Singleton pattern used in MusicPlayer

DETECTING PARTICLE COLLISIONS

Go to particle systems.

Check collisoins. Take type to world. 

Turn minkill speed up to kill particles when they collide. Mode 3D. 

Give enemies a script. 

Handle collision. Destroy enemy. 

OnParticleCollision() -> for handling collisions with particles. 

MAKING SCRIPTS ADD COMPONENTS

Add box colliders to enemies on runtime. 

gameObject.AddComponent<TypeToAdd>();
Collider col = gameObject.AddComponent<BoxCollider>();

INSTANTIATING AT RUN TIME

Use GameObject as a field. 

Then Instantiate that gameobject in some function.

UI

Can move anchors to set where object is relative to. Move anchors to all four corners.

INVOKE

Invoke -> uses a string and actually uses coroutines under the hood

Delegate -> for handling events

GIT MANAGEMENT

Stash - undo single staged changed. Doesn't delete files just changes them back. 

Branch and Reset - create new branch for project. 

ENEMY HEALTH SYSTEM

Be careful with naming variables. 

Enemy has hit points. Figure out time to kill. Number of hits it can take

LEVEL DESIGN BEAT CHART

For material to correctly scale. Find materials.

Look at tiling in secondary map. 

Can make things see through by making transparent and changing alpha. 

Level should be a roller coaster. Not same pace all the time, but changes. Moments from 1 to 10. Progression. No 10 second moments should be the same. 

Link story and player experience. 

Intensity vs Time

Have moments in a script that go up and down. 

LEVEL DESIGN ITERATION

Interesting dodging. 

TIMELINE

A tool to create cut-scenes, cinematics, and gameplay sequences by visually arranging tracks and clips linked to Game Objects in your scene. 

Use Timeline to Animate An Enemeny
-Add a Playable Director to an enemy
-Animate that enemy using timeline
-Shoot and destroy the enemy

Window > Timeline

Click on game onbject.

Go to Timeline. Click on create.

Choose where to save Playable Director 

Add animation track.

Also Activation Track, Audio Track, Control Track, Playable Track

Playable Director and ANimator are added to game object. 

Can change timeline by changing Playable in Playable Director.

Go into record button in clip

Click on Timeline, go to game object's transform, right click and choose Add key. 

If you double click track in timeline, you willl be up animation window and can change animation there. 

TIMELINE FOR PLAYER PATH

Basically use key frames for player path. 

Use curves in animations window in stead of dopesheet.

CTRL, SHIFT, ALT and mouse wheel to move graph and zoom

UNITY TIMELINE ENEMY WAVES

Nested Timelines on Control Tracks

Master Timeline -> Player Rig (Camera + Ship)

Enemy Wave Timeline -> Animatiosns for different enemy groups

Put Control Track on Master Timline. Have a Control Playable Asset that holds the enemy waves timelines. Can tell it when it will occur in overall master timeline by moving things around. 

Go to master timeline. Add control track. Give it name. Right click and add ControlPlayableAsset. Cna move it around timeline or stretch it. 

It has Source Game Object, give it the Timeline for those objects. 

Can use second wave by making a new ControlPlayableAsset.

Those objet will not exist until timeline reaches that ControlPlayableAssets

ADDING FLAVOR WITH TIMELINE

Can put timelnes int otheir own group.

Add, remove animate, switch, transitoin and do anything 
-Any game object
-SFX, voice over, music
-Cameras lights,
-particle effects
-UI elements
-character animations
-world animations

Just drag audio onto timeline. 

Can make image UI element for story dialog. 

Drag image
Add Control Track
Add control playable track

So image comes up when guy talks. 

STOP PARTICLE EMISSIONS IN C#

All lasers are deactivated when you stop firing because you are disabling whole particle system.

Instead you should disable emissions in particle system. 

var emissionModule = gun.GetComponent<ParticleSystem>().emission = false;
emissionModule.enabled = IsActive;

ADDING VISUAL POLISH

Change texture for landing platform.

Changed lighting to bluer. Also osftened skybox by changing Intensity Markup i think in ighting. 
And put intensity around 1.5

Also added fog. 
Can change mode as well. 

Softens up the background. 

Can also add particle effects to player and rocket jet.
