COMBAT

Melee, ranged, hit points, damage, and many enemies

Move player to enemy. 

ATTACKING THE ENEMIES DESIGN

1. Run to enemy; attack melee
2. Run to distance from enemy; attack ranged
3. Run past enemy even if attacked
4. Run to enemy, avoid others
5. Controller -> some aim assis, nearest/closest

Place down enemies to organize level. Can make screen shot and add design requirements

USING GIZMOS TO VISUALIZE CODE

To visualize where you are moving to to visualize where you will start. Even can visualize attack range. 

// Called every time gizmo is drawn.
OnDrawGizmos()
{
	// make line black
	Gizmos.color = Color.black;
	// draw line from object to target
	Giizmos.DrawLine(transform.position, currentClickTarget);
	// shows where player is going to
	Gizmos.DrawSphere(currentClickTarget, 0.1f);
	// shows where player will stop
	Gizmos.DrawSphere(clickPoint, 0.15f);

	// draw attack sphere
	Gizmos.color = new color(255f, 0f, 0, .5f);
	Gizmos.DrawWireSphere(transform.position, attackMoveStopRadius);
}

With OnDrawGizmos implemented in code, that class will show up in Gizmos menu in the editor. 

Red stuff are animator gizmos. 

Store clickPoint as member variable and set it in code for getting currentClickTarget. 

Shorten vector from one where we are to current click target. Make currentClickTarget/currentDestination the shorted distance between clickPoint and walkMoveStopRadius. Take vector from object to click point but shorten it by walkMoveStopRadius. 

Vecot3 ShortDestination(Vector3 dest, float shortening)
{
	Vector3 reductionVector = (destination - transform.position).nomralized * shortening;
	return destination - reductionVector;
}

Do same thing for attackMoveRadius. Do same thing except do this for enemies.

PLAYER HEALTH BAR UI

Use playerHealth images and a Health script to handle health bar. 

Use a UI element to handle health bar. Will use canvas. 

Use anchors and pivots to position it correctly. 

Health bar is twice as long as it should fill, but it wraps around. Health bar mask is a transparent mask that sits on top. Can be used for art style to be flexible.

Uses a raw image nad helath bar script. 

Gets value for health and offset to figure out where it should be.
