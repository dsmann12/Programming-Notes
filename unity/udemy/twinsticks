TWIN STICKS 2.5D

VERSION CONTROL

git and github

Sourcetree is aGUI program for git.

To use git with unity, go to Editor Settings and set Version Control to Visible Meta Files.

Then create a .gitignore file. 

CROSS PLATFORM INPUT MANAGER

Virtual Control Layer

Touch, Mouse+Keyboard, Gamepad, etc all go to Virtual Control layer which then outputs such to API like GetAxis() and GetButton()

So when changing platforms you don't need to change code. 

Assets > Import Package > CrossPlatformInput

using UnityStandardAssets.CrossPlatformInput

Use CrossPlatformInputManager. to access

Instead of using Input, use CrossPlatformInput. to access button presses, etc.

Inputs are in input settings. 

Gravity is an effect on inputs that add speed and things.

USING ANALOG GAMEPAD

Need to connect controller to pc. 

Gravity is fraction of a second that control takes to "re-center".

If set to 3, 1/3 of a second then. 

Large gravities can cause a rounding error where the 

Gravity and sensitivity only for mouse and keyboard.

Dead - dead zone. How much of input to ignore. 

Snap - holding down both direcions snaps value back to 0. 

USING ROLLER BALL PREFAB

Import characters. RollerBall is a prefab. 

Has a ball script and ball user control script that is cross platform.

Look at script. 

DESIGNING A REPLAY SYSTEM

Deterministic Event Storage Replay

Store all starting state (seeds, AI, etc etc).
Reproduce all player input.
Less storage, but simulation must run perfectly. 
Hard to rewind.

Non Deterministic State Storage

Store entire game state every frame. 
Larger file sizes, but llows random access.
Allows rewind easily too

Need class or struct

MyKeyrame:
float time;
Vector3 pos;
Quaternion rot;

Use a circular buffer. 

Can use Time.frameCount % bufSize. 

Time.frameCount tells which frame count in game it is.

CLASS VS STRUCT IN C#

Why noy use Unity's Keyframe struct. Don't need all data in this struct.

Also not use animator as it ssslower and cumbersome.

structs are stored as values and not references. 

Create replay script and attach script to player. 

CREATING A REPLAY SYSTEM

Put script on player. 

Store bufferFrame size in private const int. 
Also have array of keyframes of buffer size. 

In record mode, want objects to be nonkinematic. In playback, be kinematic. 

Get rigidbody. 

For recording. 

Frame number is Time.frameCount % bufSize

Use a game manager to manage state and decide whether to record or play back

TOUCHSCREEN JOYSTICK CONTROL

Can addd mobile single stick control prefab to use a stick on mobile.

Must also add EventSystem to track button presses. 

Adds a canvas. 

Can add buttons and such.

Can move anchors for canvas elements manually instead of using preset things

building to Android requires certain settings to specify.

LEVEL UNLOCKS IN UNITY

Use PlayerPrefs manager.

PAUSING THE GAME

Time.timeScale - used to slow down game or pause it. 

Should also lower Time.fixedDeltaTime to same amount. Time.fixedDeltaTime is the interva in seconds at which physics and other fixed frame rate updates are performed.

Can write a method. 

update method is still called each frame. Things just don't move. Physics and such. 

READING FROM SECOND STICK

Add new inputs to input manager. RightHoriz and LeftHoriz. Can change type to joystick.
Also add RightVert, and LeftVert.
Also can set axis to 3rd axis for the horizontal.
For vertical axis make it 4th axis.

Attach a script to camera. 

Use LateUpdate for camera. 

Make camera look at player every frame.

transform.LookAt(player.transform) makes camera turn to track player.

Guy uses a "selfie stick" object to lock itself to ball position. Doesn't make it a child of ball because ball is rotating. 

Gives a public float panSpeed. Also a vector3 to determine armRotation. Use EulerAngles. 

To convert back to quaternion use Quaternion.Euler(vector);
