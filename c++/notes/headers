Header is the key to managing declarations of facilities defined elsewhere in C++.
A header is a collection of delcarations, typically defined in a file, so header is also
called a header file. Such headers are "included" via #include in source files. 

Declarations are are in header such as token.h
Definitions are in token.cpp

#include "file.h" simply copies declarations from file.h ito file at point of #include

#include is part of preprocessing. 

#include header both in source files that use its declarations and in source files that
provide definitions for those declarations.
