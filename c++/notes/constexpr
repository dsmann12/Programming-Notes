constexpr - values are known at compile time

conexpr is named oject to which you can't give a new value after it has been 
initialized. 

Constant expression - is an expression with an integer value composed exclusively of
constants. Values must be known at compile time. Therefore cannot contain variables
as operands. 

Non-obvious literals in code (outside definitions of symbolic constants) are called magic 
constants.
