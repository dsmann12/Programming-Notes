Access Specifiers

public means other objects can access access variables or methods

private means only class has access to variable or method. Must
build public methods for other Classes to access private methods

protected - like combination of both. Anything inside class has
access to data. Any friend has access to data. And derived class
has access to these.

Derive does not inherit private. But does inherit public and protected.
