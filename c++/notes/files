Files - used to save data on computer permanently. 

Must include the fstream class.

#include <fstream>

ofstream -- object for files for output. Only for outputting data. 

ofstream davidsFile;

open(String s) -- method used to open file with path equal to 
string S. If file does not exist, it is created. 

davidsFile.open("input.txt"); //Now input.txt is associated with object

Also can use:
ofstream davisFile("input.txt");

Use << and >> to output and input data into file.

davidsFile << "This is david's file!\n";

Must use close() method after opening a file.

is_open() -- used on file objects. Will return true if object
is currently associated a file

EOF - is CTRL-Z in Windows. Enter key to quit program. 

while(cin >> idNumber >> name >> money) {
	theFile << idNumber << " " << name << money << endl;
}

Reading 

ifstream -- file object that takes input from file

Files work with File pointers. Like cursors in a word document. Starts at
beginning then continues until EOF.
