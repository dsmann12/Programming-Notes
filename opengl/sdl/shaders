SHADERS

Shaders are programs for GPU which handle very specific tasks for GPU.

Vertex Shader -> takes data coming from GPU and converts to form GPU can process
Fragment Shader -> takes pixels generated by GPU and decides their color

Mesh creation -> act of sending data to GPU

Create shader.h and shader.cpp

Give Shader class a Bind() method, a constructor that takes a string filename, and destructor. 

#include <GL/glew.h>

Make GLunint private variable to act as handle for program. Also private array for holding shaders. Could also do enumeration.

GLUint m_program;
GLuint m_shaders[NUM_SHADERS];

He creates helper functions LoadShader(filename) and CheckShaderError(shader, flag, isProgram, string). Check code. 

Look through code.
