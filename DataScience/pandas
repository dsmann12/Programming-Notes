PANDAS

Pandas -> open source library built on NumPy. Allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation. Excels in performance and productivity. Has built in visualization features. Can work with dat from a wide variety of sources

Call Python's version of Excel or R data frames

SERIES

Series is built on top a numpy array. Series has access labels. Can be index by label. 

labels = ['a', 'b', 'c']
my_data = [10, 20, 30]
arr = np.array(my_data)
d = {'a':10, 'b':20, 'c':30}

lists, numpy array, and dictionary

Series takes many parameters. data and index most important
pd.Series(data = my_data)
0	10
1	20
2	30 
dtype: int64

pd.Series(data = my_data, index = labels)
a	10
b	20
c	30
dtype: int64

pd.Series(arr) -> also works
pd.Series(d) -> takes keys of dictionary as indices

ser1 = pd.Series(d)

ser1['a'] -> 10
ser1[0] -> 10

ser2 = pd.Series(d)

ser1 + ser2 -> will match operation based on index. Puts NaN where can't find match
